# Personal Reading Log â€“ Data & Analysis

This repository contains my personal reading history, including dates, titles, authors, and other book-related details. It also includes data analysis scripts and visualizations exploring reading trends over time, such as books read per month, average page counts, favorite genres, and more. The goal is to track progress, uncover patterns, and share insights from my reading journey.
