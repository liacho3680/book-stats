1,city of fallen angels,cassandra clare,3.00,60.00%,425,"2,011",paranormal,teen/ya,December 30,January 5,7.0,"wow what a great start to reading my least favorite in a book series that's supposed to be my favorite series. 
(i believe third or fourth reread of this book. i'm trying to catch up in 2022/2023 to the books that are recently released in this shadowhunter realm)

and in rereading this book, no even series, really makes me question why it's supposedly my favorite series. i'm starting to think it no longer is. maybe because i love these characters so much, but the events that occur? not a fan. (like the whole maureen storyline? ugh)

suffice to say, this book is not bad, per say, and the reasons in my head for why i didn't like this book are no longer valid reasons to me why i don't like this book. but one big reason still stands, jace and clary finally become a couple but then their happy couple-ness instantly gets taken away from me >:(

positives, i guess. i did like that we get to have more of simon's persepctive, and going forward after city of glass we really do get those changing perspectives in a book, which is always fun and adds more drama and suspense in a low fantasy story world. and we get to learn more about the people in this shadowhuntery world, people excluding shadowhunters. 

overall, not as bad as i thought (maybe city of ashes will be my least favorite now)", ,
2,the hating game,sally thorne,4.50,90.00%,365,"2,016",romance,adult,January 8,January 10,3.0,"despite having this book on my tbr list for many years since it was first oh so popular on booktube, i finally got around to reading it

enemies to lovers is not really my preference of trope, but my love for josh and lucy really grew. how dimensional and complicated they both are in their own unique ways, and how they brought out the best in each other, in the worst circumstances (including when they were self-proclaimed dastardly enemies).

addicting to read and a warm hug of a conclusion to close the book :^)", ,
3,city of lost souls,cassandra clare,4.50,90.00%,535,"2,012",paranormal,teen/ya,January 5,January 15,11.0,"kinda mixed feelings, but i ultimately did enjoy reading this book (mainly because we get to have multiple storylines going at once, all to converge at the huge battle at the end). 

but man, clary is a brave, but very reckless and kinda stupid gorl. like dude, the one chance to save jace from sebastian, and she folds like a deck of cards, because ""jace can't die""

i think a large portion of me enjoying this book in the past was because i was urgently waiting for city of heavenly fire, so i now changed my rating from what it was before. still a solid book in the series, but not my favorite like with city of glass", ,
4,city of heavenly fire,cassandra clare,5.00,100.00%,725,"2,014",paranormal,teen/ya,January 16,January 22,7.0,"i can confidentially say that while rereading this series, prior to this reread, i only read this book at release. i do really, really still enjoy it. packed with intense fight scenes, plot lines wrapping up but also hints to future series in this shadowhunter world, changing perspectives (maybe for a non-fantasy reader could be overwhelming with so many changing persepctives), and strong character storyarcs (with the main 5ish). 

also just gives the satisfaction of a resolution after the past five books that gave me such an unsatisfactory feeling, conflicted and some cringe-ness.

5,the bane chronicles,cassandra clare,4.25,85.00%,507,"2,014",paranormal,teen/ya,January 22,January 29,8.0,"second time reading: 
not sure if it's because it's been so long or it's because when i first read this, i rush read it on nye so that it would count towards my reading of that year lol, so i don't remember some of these stories, if not most of them. 

really enjoyed reading them, especially after just finished rereading tid and tmi. all the little tidbits of the herondales, the lightwoods, how magnus interacts with both ragnor and tessa <3 love love love this character interaction. ", ,
6,tales from the shadowhunter academy,cassandra clare,4.50,90.00%,655,"2,016",paranormal,teen/ya,January 29,February 1,4.0,"i very much enjoyed this collection, maybe a little more than the bane chronicles, but average of all the stories about the same level of fun-ness that the bane chronicles had to an extent. 

it was exciting to read simon's path to ascension and (hinted at) becoming parabatai-ed with interlude-ish stories of both the recent and far past of beloved (and not so much) characters of this world. i especially loved the parts about tessa and will's kids (and their cousins) and am very very excited to get to reading the last hours

satisfied with this read, and wow does it give more context to next book of lady midnight, as this is the first time reading it but yet i've read lady midnight before in this whole re-reading the shadowhunters process", ,
7,displacement: a travelogue,lucy knisley,4.25,85.00%,161,"2,015",memoir,adult,February 1,February 2,2.0,"i nearly read this in one day if i didn't have schoolwork to do..

i liked this one for different reasons than relish, but overall liked relish more because it was food-related, while this book had perspectives on more? heavy? topics. of course not everyone has good relationships with their family, much less their grandparents, but i did enjoy those elements and how they were explored in this book. 

the concepts of older generations not being able to verbally or even physically show love to others, to family, but yet lucy understands this divide and continues and continues to bridge that gap, taking that step to say ""I love you"" and earnestly hug them. 

very heartwarming but also contemplative notes to have about one's past and future and the past and future generations. ", ,
8,nora goes off script,annabel monaghan,4.25,85.00%,272,"2,022",romance,fame/celebrity,February 2,February 5,4.0,"as i've probably said before but i am a sucker for these almost cliche-y but not really because they have deep emotions that the characters need to process. like the hallmark romance movies that nora writes but they have some actual depth and human emotion/realism. 

also despite knowing the ""evils"" of hollywood, i'm always charmed by a hollywood romance novel. maybe because of the thrill of it, and also the romanticism of the environment and circumstances. 

but i really did love reading this book, equal parts fun and light yet leaning more on the emotional serious side at the same time. it was over the span of almost 20ish hours, including me doing other things and sleep (lol) in which i read this book, thus showing how much i was sucked into this story of nora and leo. 

vague-ish spoiler, but i was a bit surprised at the twist, or at least how it happened. when the conflict started to occur, i did guess it could stem from misunderstanding and pretenses, but was not expecting it to be delivered in the manner that it was. 

only minor gripe was how the mc and the ml resolved and reconnected so quickly, and then bam happy ending and the book ends. though i can see how they ""talked"" through the miscommunication, but i feel like there could have been more time in-between the realization of a misunderstanding to then happiness and love. or maybe that's more a ""realistic"" vision and this is a romance novel that shouldn't drag the ending. hmm.

9,the bodyguard,katherine center,3.75,75.00%,302,"2,022",romance,fame/celebrity,February 3,February 5,3.0,"I have conflicting feelings about this book. but I did enjoy reading it (although I was really annoyed that the author mixed up judo and jujitsu based on how the mc could flip a person running full speed at them, smh...though overall this was a very minor gripe but still annoying at the time lol)

bare bones, this book has all the aspects of a romance novel that I enjoy, all those fun cliches, fake-dating, a celebrity involved, bad-ass mc female. and with those specific tropes were delivered, and 
I was satisfied with them. 

on the other hand, the cliche-ness of the whole book was a bit too cheesy for me, especially in the first quarter/third of the book. okay we get it, you're a workaholic, had a traumatic childhood, kinda distant mom that just died, your boyfriend dumps you the day after said mom's funeral, <spoiler> your best friend hooks up and promptly dates said ex boyfriend the week after being dumped by him as you're mourning your heartbreak over the phone with her,</spoiler> yada yada. all of this was just too much trope-y cliche-y in a bad way, all at once. like the mc kept referring to herself as a shark during an argument with her boss, as to why she needed to keep working and not to take time off to mourn the death of her mom (like it's quirky, I guess, but why so many times). all of these stressors just felt almost unnatural, in the way it was delivered, like in those bad but good but mostly bad rom-com's.

overall, I did enjoy reading this book. but I think I would rather reach for other fake-dating, falling-in-love-with-the-bodyguard books rather than this one, I guess. ", ,
10,lady midnight,cassandra clare,4.50,90.00%,688,"2,016",fantasy,teen/ya,February 6,February 21,16.0,"last time when i read this book it took me over a year, as the plot was rolling out intently but seemingly slowly (granted this is the first in a trilogy so there is much exposition and context needed to be done considering the events of city of heavenly fire which makes sense) but man i could only read this book in spurts, never all at once like i've done with the other books in my re-read of the shadowhunter chronicles (speaking of, i've caught up and now get to read new material heh)

since it's been almost 6 years, not including the time it took reading this book the first time, the whole plot of this book was basically a mystery to me. so it was like reading this book for the first time, with all the knowledge of the other books in this shadow world fresh in my brain. YET, i'm a doofus and spoiled parts of not only this book but also this trilogy because i got impatient and curious about characters and read the wiki character pages ._. so i found out about betrayals and deaths and lies and character reveals wayy too soon. ugh. 

but despite all that, i did enjoy reading this book. such a rich story with many layers and complications that the blackthorn children encounter. (though the plot arc vaguely follows tid and tmi plot arcs but different-ish which makes this plot arc repetitive yet not quite) a good start to this series of the dark artifices. and, my god are things complicated aha. ", ,
11,a long conversation,cassandra clare,4.00,80.00%,28,"2,017",fantasy,teen/ya,March 26,March 26,1.0,"in almost being finished with the lord of the shadows (which by the way is taking me incredibly long to finish, but at least not as long as when i first ready lady midnight lol), i find out that this little novella from clary's perspective right before the end end of lady midnight/beginning of lord of the shadows 

and mannnnnnnn i love me some of the og group and them having fun and vibing. just makes me happy reading them, like seeing an old friend again. 

(s/o to someone on tumblr who posted this novella for those that didn't have the 1st edition)
", ,
12,lord of shadows,cassandra clare,4.25,85.00%,699,"2,017",fantasy,teen/ya,February 21,March 27,35.0,"reading this book was truly a marathon that took much longer, including a week or two break in between. it took 34 days to be exact. but my god, that was... something

even the plot itself, was very dense and slow-moving, akin to lady midnight, but yet packed full with story and characters and tension, which thus made it difficult to speed through as i normally do. not to say that things should have been left out, but after reading both this book, lord of the shadows and lady midnight, leaves you feeling reeling, lost, and head full of cotton like the end of a christopher nolan movie. 

the last quarter? of the book i was on my toes, teetering between reading large chunks so i can get to the ""conclusion"" and shying away because it was giving me anxiety with all the tension. with all the puzzle pieces that needed to perfectly fit during the consul meeting, it gave me a sense of hope. and yet i had that dreading feelings as with all books (especially since plot-wise there were to be a whole another thick boy of a book after this one) that Something Was Going To Go Wrong.

yes i did know what was to occur in the last end of the book, because i was a dumbass and was googling and wikipedia-ing the blackthorns and saw the character pages indicate... well let's just say recent events. but i did not know when they were to occur other than in this trilogy and man, i-

much to say that overall i did enjoy reading this book. :-) it was not a flabergastingly amazing book but definitely an adventure with the blackthorns and new and old friends that they meet along the way, all in to save their sister helen and aline from exile", ,
13,icebreaker,hannah grace,4.00,80.00%,435,"2,022",romance,sports,March 28,March 29,2.0,"i feel like that 7tv emote AAAA right now (if you don't know, it's a gif of a distorted cat that looks like it's manically yelling)

this book was truly crack for my romance-loving soul, despite being indifferent to the enemies to lovers trope. also second favorite trope after fake-dating is a sports romance and this did really deliver. i feel the sports romance books i come across are often only set in high school and it was refreshing reading about characters who were in college. i enjoyed this book so much that i nearly read it in one day, going to bed late just because i was so close to the pinnacle of the story, when stassie goes to nationals and then i forced myself to go to bed because i have class in 8 hours. then i woke up early and finished the book lolol

but truly this book was fun yet serious, with stassie needing to overcome her fears and get over those hangups that she's had for a large portion of her life (and as a person that overthinks all the time to an unhealthy extent, i understood her and even related to her at certain points)

the cast of characters were so much fun and make me wish just for a second that i was apart of a jock-friend group in college. just a smidge. but as they were fun they were caring and loving and a little found family of their own though mostly comprised of straight men in collegiate sports lol. 

the minor detail that irked me was when stassie had the same therapist from washington while she was in california. not sure how laws work for california and maybe the author is pulling a loophole, but from learning from a close friend that you have to have a psychologist who is licensed in the same state as you are residing in. i understand for plot purposes that stassie having the same psychologist from when she was back home was pivotal for her to go back home to visit but meh 

damn. now after reading this book i wanna read another collegiate sports romance…

14,the deal,elle kennedy,3.75,75.00%,360,"2,015",romance,sports,March 29,March 30,368.0,"after reading icebreaker and loving it so much, i was desperate for another sports romance with the characters in college, so here we are (no i'm not delaying reading queen of air and darkness wdym...)

maybe because of a byproduct of reading so many rom-com-y and romance books but most of the major plot points i figured out as i was reading, but despite that (ignoring the little cringe moments) it was enjoyable. will i continue reading the next book in this loosely defined series? maybe... (probably lol) 

i do appreciate that both the male love interest and female lead tackled known heavy topics well and that aspect was not cringe and quite heartwarming with how both hannah and garrett overcame their internal and external struggles", ,
15,book lovers,emily henry,4.75,95.00%,377,"2,022",romance,adult,March 31,April 1,2.0,"going into this book i was a bit apprehensive, for no reason. but my god, i love this book so much. 

the banter, the tension, nora going through waves of fear and anxiety along with the need for control. but also her having such a big growth arc, though maybe not life-changing insane growth but almost realistic baby-step changes and revamping her brain. and i love that for her. 

i was very meh about charlie in the prologue, maybe because the way he was described but it was a turn-off... then as we got to know him more, as nora got to know him more, i grew to love him. 

i think this is my favorite emily henry book. for many reasons but the big one being that i relate to nora in some way of the fear of things out of control, that things would fall apart and nothing will be the same again. and learning and growing out of those fears, acceptance in some ways and taking winning little fights for control in other ways.

sidenote i thought that i would be slow going into this because i was so aprehensive but gUESS not and read it so fast last night lolol", ,
16,queen of air and darkness,cassandra clare,4.50,90.00%,893,"2,018",fantasy,teen/ya,April 2,April 13,12.0,"AAAA (7tv twitch emote of a cat yelling) 
reading this book took much shorter than i thought it would but man after the initial hump of getting over how large and kinda cumbersome it was, i got hooked onto the story very quick. despite a marathon of a read, it felt like a very fast marathon :^)

i also love the cameos/appearances of the old og cast (clary and jace, jem and tessa have my heart. but also magnus and alec and simon and isabelle <3)

the buildup of this book and just overall how the plot flowed out was agonizing with how long and intensive it was yet it was a rollercoaster that i ended up enjoying being on. 

i don't have much to say other than i was very antsy for the end to resolve with the whole cohort situation and yet wanting to stay longer with the blackthorns. it's a complicated ending but i'm happy that things ended in the best way that it could considering the events of the huge battle and such.

(not spoilers but wtff was that epilogue ending???? i'm assuming those plot strands will resolve in a future book? wicked powers mayhaps?)", ,
17,second first impressions,sally thorne,3.75,75.00%,343,"2,021",romance,adult,May 8,April 17,710.0,"given the fact that i started reading this book nearly two years ago and was on and off for the first quarter to third of the book shows how long it took for me to get into it. did not help that i found mel more annoying than endearing with her very snarky? direct and blunt way of helping ruthie. especially when not just mel but also some of the other characters saw ruthie as this sheltered no-life person and almost looked down upon that just bothered me. (maybe because my younger self also related to the quiet, goody-two-shoes kid that maybe has/had anxiety and had a past of losing things or forgetting things due to clumsiness and being constantly reminded of that flaw)

also as a further sidenote, and only a personal thing but ml's with long hair is just a turn off for me and it took awhile to love teddy (though the tats... 0-0) 

BUT other than those gripes, i did very much enjoy the remaining portion of the book (two-thirdsish) and grew to love teddy and mel more and more and understood the many faults of ruthie as well. a very solid growth arc, of learning and trust and enjoying the moment.", ,
18,lovelight farms,b.k. borison,3.75,75.00%,336,"2,021",romance,adult,April 20,April 24,5.0,"i think i read this book simply to read the loose sequel with beckett and evelyn. but the promise of fake-dating appealed to me... and i was mildly disappointed. it didn't deliver the fake-dating juiciness and fun that i normally get ._.

maybe because it was nearly insufferable reading the back and forth, the chemistry and connection that stella and luka have yet are so clueless??? blind?? putting dumb stupid denial as reasoning as to ""they don't like me""?! reflecting on those plot points makes me want to shake their dumb heads. 

but otherwise i did enjoy the small-town vibes (a la gilmore girls of stars hallow and others). the neighbors/community was overbearing but in an endearing way and not an annoying intrusive way. i do enjoy a good christmas themed novel, and on a christmas tree farm? very fun.

(minor spoiler but wtf was that attempt at a spanner in the works in the last two chapters of the book? it felt so rushed with the conflict and resolution of that, just bleh.)

overall it had it's pros and cons but it was a fun read.", ,
19,happy place,emily henry,5.00,100.00%,400,"2,023",romance,adult,April 26,April 28,3.0,"i love love love this book
from starting the first few chapters, i loved how it had all the elements of a fun romance read (fake dating, tight-knit group of friends, an attractive ml etc etc) YET it also had the realism strong (or at least a lot more prominent than other books typical of the genre) and the problems very evident and kept the decision-making of the characters somewhat grounded. 

it really felt like a coming of age romance novel despite the mc and her friends being in their early thirties(?). but maybe it's like the saying ""30's are the new 20's"". how these characters want to cling to those ""good times"" whilst ignoring or not recognizing the bad and wanting to live in the past despite that people grow and change and get older. and it's not a bad thing. 

the central theme being relationships, and not simply just romantic ones but platonic friendship ones too. this book really showcased the awkward, frustrating, painful experience of transitioning out of college/early 20's relationships and those declarations of being friends forever to going back to reality. how it may not end up like that, how those ""life-long"" friendships can evolve as we get older. 

i understood harriet's struggles and her fears, some of them being my own from the past and the present. her need for control and stability in an environment or dynamic where trying to defuse the situation may not be the best or healthy thing to do. the fear of confrontation.

overall i really loved this book, as you can tell, it took me less than 48 hours read it and that is during the release of a highly-anticipated rpg game that came out the same day as this book did lololol 

5 stars (with a slight hesitancy on doing so because i don't want to give it a hard 5 stars but yet i do lmao)

but i really enjoyed this book. maybe this further fuels my fantasy of living in a small town being a farmer or baker or something. 

i loved the whole opposites attract with beckett and evie but also they are not entirely opposites because people are multifaceted and can have varied interests. i personally related to beckett on some level, and found his behaviors charming and his crutches relatable. (maybe that’s why i get so frustrated with miscommunication with stories just because i too struggle with having open-communication hmmm…)

overall a good fun read but also has some good points especially towards those self-sacrificing, people-pleasing types D:", ,

a woman who constanly overthinks 🤝🏼 a man who has solutions and reassurances for every problem

this was a fun cute book. not to mention my love for the fake-dating trope really shone here. 

and the representation of a spanish family? love (esp as a person that loves the culture of spain from studying it all throughout high school) and the little dialogue lines of spanish were cool (but i could imagine a bit cumbersome for those that cannot read spanish and would have to look up every translation)

the lead up to the actual fake dating in spain was a bit too drawn out imo. just the back and forth and back and forth of if lina was actually gonna accept the proposition even though we (kinda) know and just meta-wise the plot only works if aaron does go lmao. though the slow development of their relationship, building of trust and friendship i did enjoy. 

also ms gurl was taking so long to trust aaron that it got a little annoying with all the doubts and self-gaslighting. like i get it, with the past relationship trauma and the circumstances surrounding it but c’mon even after many signs from aaron and the level of commitment he puts out? aiyah. and the whole plotline of lina believing that he definitely hates her even though she tried to be nice to him just gahh. bleh.

suffice to say that i really, really love this book. it’s emotional, heartbreaking, yet real and true, descriptors that are in actuality vague and not descriptive at all but c’est la vie. 

though myself am a young person that only is in the tail end of schooling, the emotional ups and downs sam and sadie go through, i understood and related to. the pain and loss, selfishness and stubborness, the feeling of losing yourself to a game when it feels like your small and minute yet very real world is falling apart at the seems. 

these rich characters, in depth and with their growth and failure arcs compelled me from the start. even how the information, the story arcs and how the chapters were laid out, i much enjoyed. also in having diverse minority characters, especially during the time were it starts in the 90’s? :-) love.

but anyways, i’d like to give context. have enjoyed hazel’s youtube content since the days she was under chewingsand, and was excited (and a little nervous) when she announced of a book. after the first few youtubers would release books, i have been always skeptical of them since. not to say that this book is perfect or it isn’t, but I think that overall hazel  did a great job and conveying the emotional journey of a person going through trauma through a relationship, and the pitfalls that occur in tandem because of it. 

when i first started reading this book, i had to put it down after a few chapters due to its emotional heaviness as it was a very stressful lead-up to finals and i needed something light instead. as with the nature of the book’s structure, the emotional heaviness does receed a bit, as we progress backwards into the mc’s life though the story of her and theo’s relationship. 

overall was an enjoyable but quite an emotional book to read. would maybe not rec for those that would be triggered by familial abuse, anxiety, depression, & su1c*de (don’t want to go too in-depth but those topics do get covered, though in reference to the past, and volume of the content decreases down the list)", ,

the amount of times i have heard something along the lines of ""you're young, you have so much freedom in trying so many things. the agency to make mistakes and learn new things"" and while yes, i can understand what they mean, and how they even might be nostalgic of that time in their life, the sentiment feels very repetitive to me. lucy's journey through this travelogue, with all the stumbling in and out of circumstances, the anxieties and the feelings of simply living life, really shine in this book.

this is my third lucy kinsey book that i have read, and i have enjoyed each one immensely. not only the light-hearted, but nonetheless beautiful drawings, but also having thought-provoking, the coming-of-age feeling of looking at your world and your placement in it, draws me in every time.

the title (and its backstory) intrigues me, has me reflecting on my own period in my life. how i have a love-hate feeling towards this current transitory phase in my life and all the ups and downs and experiences it brings.

overall this review has not much reflection of the book other than a connection to the main themes lolol but tidr; pretty pictures, but also thinking about life optimistically for the most part (which is a favorite theme of mine)", ,

suffice to say that i had much fun reading this book and enjoyed every spare moment i had while working to read hehehe 

yes, it is “cliche” and maybe a little predictable and it was full of the classic grumpy x sunshine trope but idc it was fun and maybe just because i was coming off of watching gilmore girls but amelia and noah had some strong lorelai and luke vibes and i was all for it. 

minor gripes; was quite cheesy but imo it was a the good tolerable cheesy and not the cringey cheesy (though amelia calling herself a certain emoji during a steamy moment really threw me off and made me cringe). also what is this slander of noah’s lack of internet and him liking “stereotypical dude rock music” and reading nonfiction biographies? why the lowkey shade?? uncalled for. 

i started to read this book simply so i could have context for the non-sequel sequel and was very pleasantly surprised.

i love this book maybe slightly more than when in rome simply because of the relatability and the mixture of rom-com feelings and tropes in the book with very grounded and realistic follow through (imo) i'm also very curious about maddie's story which (supposely) is to be next. 

just content feelings after finishing this book and that's that.

was hesitant to read, only did just because i enjoyed when in rome and practice makes perfect, not to mention the reviews of this book was very...mixed. but the friends to lovers AND fake dating tropes made me very curious about this book. i think at the end of the day it was fun to read, but the amount of times i was laughing at the characters (nathan and bree) for the absurdity and extreme self-doubt that the two of them were weaving about the other, was so many. and the cringe? nearly through the roof, but again not like a oh-god cringe but like a i'm laughing at this cringey-ness. 

but i think it's a testament as to me reading this book within 18 hour-period that it was definitely fun to read. so yeah.

individual reviews:

the lovers:
maybe because of the translation the writing style took a moment to get used to but enjoyed this one. melancholy and bittersweet with a positive note at the end as fumiko adjusts to her boyfriend leaving. 
3.75 stars

the husband and wife:
enjoyed learning more “backstory” of the other characters that hang out in the cafe. this one about fusagi was heartbreaking with the circumstances and how illness not only affects the one sick but the people around them. 
3.75 stars

the sisters:
i think i’ve enjoyed this story the most, maybe because of the contrast of two characters, hirai and kumi. how much hirai had lived life with freedom and little whim yet she held so much notion about her younger sister and felt some mixed of guilt and annoyance after disconnecting from her immediate family. yet it all gets connected together by love. 
4 stars

the mother and child:
i think i love this story the most our of the four. similar to the other stories, it does have a note of melancholy but also hopeful of the future and like how kei realizes, a change of heart. despite traveling to the past or the future and the butterfly effect cannot occur, it’s the person time-traveling, the one experiencing a new perspective that has a change of heart. and i love that.

30,the american roommate experiment,elena armas,3.75,75.00%,400,"2,022",romance,adult,July 18,July 24,7.0,"despite me loving the spanish love deception, i just couldn’t enjoy this one as much. all the elements were there, from the experimental dating, a mc romance writer, ml with a connection to lina a character i loved from the previous book. but alas

i think it was simply i couldn’t fall in love with lucas. not that he was a bad person or even a badly made character/ml, just his vibe i couldn’t vibe with, couldn’t love him. (my guess is the slight machismo energy bc of his spanish background I’m not crazy about)

I did enjoy the journey that rosie and lucas went through, how they had similar trajectories of feeling lost in their purpose and their dream crumbling a bit in front of them, being stuck and not knowing what to do. 

also slightly sad that there wasn’t as much taco interaction as i wanted ._. lol

overall it was fun to read but ultimately not my cup of tea despite very promising factors

this was my first brandon sanderson novel and man after finishing this one, it really encourages me to take a stab at his other books that i’ve been meaning to reading for awhile now. some of the reviews I saw of this book with it being “not as good as his other books” or something makes me curious about his other books

but i digress, i loved the way he told? showed? worldbuilding of this sci fi ish fantasy world with dimensions and time travel esque elements. i really loved how you would explore with the mc this new world he was thrust into on top of losing his memory. many twists and turns and ironic and funny coincidences that make the story all the more enjoyable. 

the characters intriguing, how they all had backstories, many that were unexpected at first instance, and how they each grew or changed through the story

overall very much enjoyed reading this one", ,
32,see you yesterday,rachel lynn solomon,4.25,85.00%,419,"2,022",romance,teen/ya,July 30,August 3,5.0,"i first picked up this book on a whim since i had a coupon for the bookstore on my birthday and the premise sounded fun even though the thought of college makes me a little melancholy since i miss the fun parts of it and feel that it went by too quickly…but i digress.

i have quite a fondness for time travel stories, especially the magical realism kind (e.g., one of my favorite movies is about time) and reading this book was no exception of me enjoying it immensely

though i’m not a fanatic of the grumpy(or in this case more reserved quiet) x sunshine trope per say but when executed well, i do very much enjoy it. barrett and miles fill my heart, how fully flawed and human yet so idealistic, optimistic, to even a fault. i related to both of their struggles in certain aspects, cried when barrett finally told someone, how she realized she had to let go and not keep bottling up those emotioms, her acceptance of needing to be vulnerable to fully heal.

34,same time next summer,annabel monaghan,3.75,75.00%,320,"2,023",romance,adult,August 28,September 5,9.0,"the premise intrigued me when i firsted picked it up, especially since i enjoyed monaghan's debut so much. as i kept reading, i had this vague premonition? feeling? that the direction of the book was going, i didn't really want for our main character, sam.

i wanted to like this book but something just didn't vibe with me, personally. overall it was fun to read and i liked the back and forth perspectives with the short chapters between sam and wyatt both in the present and the past. how the story and the main plot point was fun leading up to, learning more about the two's life when they were growing up and what occurred between them for sam to be so cautious and guarded in the present time.

also the thing i expected the book would go into, the trajectory that it did, i was not crazy about, but i guess this is more a nitpicky thing and given that this is a romance novel, i tried to be more forgiving of the childhood lovers trope aha. but it was how sam would leave jack for wyatt, i was not crazy about. how she would essentially jump from one relationship to another after going through many life crises just felt too fast and ideally i would've liked a time skip of like at least a few months after breaking it off with jack to be with wyatt. idk. shrug
BUT, alternatively i did enjoy how sam took the steps to change her life, realizing the rut, this box that she put herself in to protect herself in a sense. and how she took strides to grow and change her circumstances for the better.

sam's character growth, aside from romantic aspects, i did enjoy reading. how she grew from a big change in her life when she was younger and the bitterness that she held onto from her childhood finally unpacking it and the growth from it was exciting.", ,
35,the hat trick,madi danielle,3.00,60.00%,514,"2,023",romance,sports,October 1,October 2,2.0,"I picked this book up solely because I was so curious based off the premise with the square? poly but the dudes aren't into each other romance. For the most part, it was enjoyable but the amount of spice was a bit too much (in my own preference)

wish there was more group dynamics that didn't become sexual and more of the getting to know each other more. looking back, it felt like some of said group dynamics in a non-sexual context were going by fast then boom spice. (again not my ideal preference, I would like more lead up). I think the author delivered what she said to deliver, but in an ideal world I would have wanted more depth to the characters beyond what was just told to us with their live circumstances

I did enjoy reading from the four perspectives, learning more about them individually (but again ! sad about the lack of depth in terms of how it relates to other characters. felt like each one was in their own world and then they went into a bubble universe to have their dalliances)

<spoiler> also i was disappointed that the plotline with chandler's home life and her younger ""catty"" sisters and apparently very critical? belittling mother was never talked about again other than maybe a passing mention after the one appearance when she visits in boston. and the loving caring, yet not fighting for chandler and just keeping the peace father. like ??? it felt like it would have been a good moment when they reconnect from their break for chandler to talk about her insecurities stemming from her ex and him cheating on her, along with the bad upbringing of her mother with the belittling hinted at when chandler was younger living at home. </spoiler>

overall, I think the book delivered what it promised but I was hopeful for more depth or relationship building outside of a sexual context and didn't really get the payoff from this that I had expected the way it seemed the more serious topics were leading to.", ,
36,if only you,chloe liese,5.00,100.00%,376,"2,023",romance,sports,October 4,October 4,1.0,"10/4/23: 1st read
i had the first of this series in my tbr for i think a couple months now but never took the chance to read it, just cause i wasn't in the mood to read the first book in the series. even if for series that ""doesn't matter to read the previous books"" but normally i still care about reading the previous books bc i love easter eggs and revisiting old characters. but when browsing last night for a book to read this premise really stood out to me and already got me hooked. so thus i ignored those feelings of needing to read the previous books that of my own volition and fast forward 14 hours later (including sleeping and going to class) i finish this book HAHA

so safe to say that i really really love this book and enjoyed it very much. the emotionality of the two characters, ziggy and seb. how they bond and grow individually and together. i love the opposites attract vibes yet they have much in common, just take some time to find that commonality. (i have so many feelings that i can't even comprehend them into words so ehhahlfjkwbkel) i love these two dearly and yeah.

and the overall plot arc along side the character arcs went so well?? imo, just how everything flowed together. bouncing back and forth between seb and ziggy's perspectives and how they developed their friendship for a long while, before any serious romance stuff to be on the table (though was playfully teased about it a few times). i also like how the author had timeskips or time just going by, but they felt quite seamless? natural. maybe a little too seamless as sometimes i would pause before checking that a couple weeks went by or such in the story. 

also this big happy messy yet fun family has found my heart and well now time to read the other books in this series heh

just love the character growth of a ""bad"" boy and a ""good"" girl who learn to love themselves and each other (platonically, then romantically). and really, i'm just a sucker for a good fake dating (though more fake friendship in this case) trope ahaha", ,
37,only when it’s us,chloe liese,4.25,85.00%,388,"2,020",romance,sports,October 4,October 6,3.0,"even though i may not like ryder's book more than ziggy's i still very much enjoyed it (i.e. the first book in this series vs. the first book of the series that i read)

the snarky back and forth between our two main leads was funny and made me all giggly that they obviously felt things about each other from the beginning, just took awhile to unpack those feelings and recognize them. both character arcs, the emotional, physical journeys that they went through were intense? but the payoff was good. idk what i'm saying but basically both characters have baggage that they had prior to meeting and while not entirely freed from said baggage they go on this journey (whether they both realize it sooner or not) together to heal from the pain

i've mentioned it before in my review of ziggy's book (B6; If Only You) but the author's pacing feels right, well-paced. yes, it may be slowburn romance (which i love personally, just because i want characters to know each other more, to build that relationship before more romance is involved) with some spice mingled in there, but i feel it's done well. i also do see that this book and ziggy's book do have similar plot arcs, with both the love interest? the non-bergman child of the couple having a murky childhood and them navigating it while the bergman child also has their own issues to deal with. not sure if this similarity is more coincidence? as in not every book in the series would have this arc but so far i am noting this common theme i guess.

again, i love the big family dynamics, how they are all tight knit. but also the friends of ryder and willa both being involved in their lives too. the meddling of the friends and family feels like the right level of meddling towards the mc's but not annoying level of meddling where they go too far and the main characters need to get there on their own without the ""side"" characters doing all the heavy lifting.

overall, i really enjoyed this book. though the grumpy x sunshine with a bit of a twist is not my go-to trope per say but i did like that element and how it was delivered in here. also am a sucker for sports-related/adjacent romance, along with characters going through emotional journeys so that was nice? fun? i liked that part a lot too. heh", ,
38,always only you,chloe liese,4.25,85.00%,384,"2,020",romance,sports,October 6,October 9,4.0,"i think i love this book more than the previous but not as much as ziggy's book (tbh after reading the summaries of all the books in the series so far i don't think any book will likely top it lol) but nevertheless i very much enjoyed this book. did enjoy the secret pining(?) trope along with sports (hockey to be more specific) romance :D and i love frankie and ren a lot and now i want a ren-like person in my life ... sigh

as i've mentioned in the ""book 1"" of this ""series"" i do see a pattern of a general plot arc. granted that this follows just any romance book so that tracks, but i enjoy it? like how these two main characters that are flawed and human and start to grow from their shortcomings as in the process of falling in love with each other. another unrelated thing, but with how an autistic character was portrayed felt right? though myself personally am not, but from friendships, this portrayal of it feels real and a ""good"" depiction of it. whatever good means uhm aha.

I feel like i'd reiterate some sentiments from my thoughts/review of the other two books i've read in this series so i'll summarize my brief thoughts:
so basically i love how these characters feel fleshed out, whole human being that are real feeling. and the emotional journeys they go on. it also helps that they each seem to have interests that are the same to me or intriguing to me, so it's fun to read from their perspective. and the method of different cultures, more with the swedish with the bergman side rather than the other ML/MC's side, but still prominent enough that again makes the character feel real. also the easter egg of how the a-frame house connects back to the bergman family :) i like that small detail. 

but yeah idk, words feelings thoughts in my brain that can't fully be articulated right now. or ever. 

side note: love that both tessa violet and lorde were on the playlist. esp a ""deep cut"" from pure heroine :D", ,
39,ever after always,chloe liese,4.50,90.00%,358,"2,021",romance,adult,August 2,October 12,72.0,"i loved this one very much, maybe because it's in the perspective of characters that i have gotten to know more reading the previous books in the ""series"" and also just more bergman family interaction due to the family vacation also made it so much fun to read

from my very limited perspective on marriage and navigating that life experience, it did feel very grounded and realistic. both aiden and freya have many faults which lead them to the road of resentment/fear and miscommunication. but how they healed and learned from those faults with practice and failure but forgiveness felt very genuine? idk how to phrase it. as i personally view it (and often struggle with), how much communication between people is very important, and reading this book about the main couple navigating those struggles but coming out in the end felt validating? reassuring?

i think out of the stories i've read about married couples, many of them are about how they lead to divorce and not many about how they repair and grow from their fault line point. so that was a nice experience to have a storyline go different. <spoiler>also i had a very strong suspicion about the father once it was first alluded to when him and aiden talked and the vindication that i was right but also surprised that it went that route because even though i guessed it was not expecting for the book to go that route. but it did execute it decently enough, but also without wrapping it up too quickly. OH also the injury. i also had a suspicion that it might occur during the trip. heh. </spoiler>

overall i loved this book because of the very real elements of marriage and learning to grow and love each other as you grow older and intimacy and ""the spark"" can look different for different people in different periods of their life. also many fun large-family dynamics as they go on a family vacation and bergman brother antics ensue lol. 

(minor sidenote: but after binging the last 4 books that i've read being of this series and only having 2 more left is killing me, not looking forward to the withdrawals that i'll have because i no longer can read about this fun loveable family *_* but i'm forcing myself to finish tender is the night because i've been on the last ~100 pages on it for nearly two months uhm lol)", ,
40,tender is the night,f. scott fitzgerald,3.75,75.00%,430,"1,934",contemporary,romance,October 19,October 18,0.0,"by jove i've finally finished this seemingly short book that took nearly three months to do so. kajfjawekfjaksdv

once i'd learn of the details of rosemary (though i suspected it from the start but was feeling hopeful that it wasn't the case) and dick, the whole drive to read this book fell down the drain. yes maybe it was a ""different time"" or whatever, but that doesn't make me less uncomfortable or grossed out by the fact that this 30-something man is attracted to a barely of age (and initially when they meet underage) kid who he has an affair with, because, shocker, he's married to also a young woman in her (mid?) 20's. 

now to get into some spoilers, (that i won't hide but will gloss over just because this book is old and i cba lol). once i was able to barely move on with the whole dick and rosemary affair situation (reading rosemary's section was painful. very painful. honestly the one moment that i could remember that i liked was the duel scene(s) and the lead up and aftermath. some action and entertainment along with confusion aha). i got to appreciate? enjoy reading about the other individuals staying at the riviera. really leans into the whole vibe of rich people doing dumb shit and being pretty racist and also going to prison a few times. the insanity of those scenarios were fun to read. 

definitely enjoyed dick and nicole's sections much more, maybe because i got used to the characters and finally invested enough to be interested to hear more about their backstories and entanglements. (also my further annoyance of dick as i find out he's a late 20-something doctor that falls in love with his psychiatric patient that i think was also barely of age and marries her to help give treatment or whatever bs that he was trying to spin) 

the prose of fitzgerald really was the final driving point of me keep reading despite all the ick factors and red flags that was dick diver. though not much, but the partial analysis that i did read, the essays and analysis about the book also made it more fun to digest the nuance of it all. like ap english class but lower stakes and no time requirement (which imo was my favorite parts of english class: reading and analyzing and discussing the book).", ,
41,with you forever,chloe liese,4.25,85.00%,350,"2,021",romance,adult,October 19,October 21,3.0,"first off the playlist songs, at least of the good handful of them i love; the aces, harry styles, maggie rogers ugh very good

my brain is tired and it's been a few hours since i finished the book and all the feelings i had that i meant to write down for this review kinda fell out of my brain so here's the quick bits:
-always love a book with pets active in the story, even if they are not integral to the plot
-grumpy x sunshine trope but it worked well i think, especially when both learn to trust each other and open up despite their initial tension
-the marriage of convenience trope felt like it didn't really shine, esp was hoping that it would be more relevant outside of rooney and axel but idk maybe it will come up in the next book
-maybe because i read a different book and not the previous book in the series right before reading this so i enjoyed this book a lot
-would put this i think around equal par of freya and aiden's book, only maybe docked a point because of the marriage of convenience trope didn't go beyond what i'd hope, connecting back, beyond just little antics along with rooney and axel forced to be in the same room together and talk about their feelings
-i did like how the game of charades at the end of the previous book connects back here, a leading element
-basically everything was good except maybe the ending felt a bit rushed and ended so suddenly with the reconnect of the two characters, with minor plothole? ignorance of the marriage storyline

overall fun, i laughed and giggled and kicked my legs basically whenever the two idiots were interacting but the whole story felt like it wrapped up a little too quickly for me
", ,
42,everything for you,chloe liese,4.25,85.00%,356,"2,022",romance,sports,October 25,October 26,2.0,"it took slightly longer to finish this book just because i was not ready for the fact that the final(!!) book that is new to me will be released in next april 

i think i like the characters a lot, but like with other people's criticisms, along with my minor criticisms for the characters of previous books where they all tend to have a similar storyline, the ""love interest"", i.e. the non-bergman person feels a bit underdeveloped. the lead up for oliver was great, based off the last book's ending hints and how the story started for this book but gavin's fell a little flat for me. especially considering the fact (which i notice is reoccurring for all these ""love interest"" characters) that we have their perspective yet their family history is very lightly touched upon. yes, gavin does not want to talk about it, but at least some background or more mentions of why gavin despises his family (other than the quick telling of it towards the end ://). 

the grandpas were fun and their dynamic with gavin was fun (though also would have liked to see more about them beyond the poker nights). it was cool to see them and other characters all connect back with other side characters or even main characters from previous books, like a fun easter egg. also the weddings?! a nice touch for those that stuck around with these characters since book 1, though kinda sucky for those that did not. 

overall i did enjoy this, though the plot felt a bit fast with the time skips (like right off the bat after the first chapter. would have also liked to see more about oliver meeting the team or even up until he meets gavin before the jumpcut to when they're forced to be co-captains). not sure if it's a ""thing"" but again noticed that all the books are 30-35ish chapters, so wonder if the storylines were cut short or forced out due to meeting the ""required"" length that match all the other books. 

((now looking back, wonder if i should go back and reaccess my ratings for the other books in the series since a handful of these issues seem to be a reoccurring theme hmmm))

but yeah. despite all that, i love these characters so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i did enjoy the book despite all the errors and yes i will be rereading ziggy's book again even though i read it literally this month (early october!), just so i can now see other characters after being ""formally"" introduced to them in their respective ""main"" books.", ,
43,the no-show,beth o'leary,3.00,60.00%,337,"2,022",contemporary,romance,October 21,October 28,8.0,"maybe i spoiled it for myself, because i suspected it after a couple chapters, by reading reviews that hinted at a twist. which actually helped speed me reading it, but more just to know what it was. and to be honest, meh.
maybe because one of the three reasonings that i guess was true, just because i guessed right? or just the whole concept of the story fell flat to me. not sure what specifically needed to change?

the entire delivery of each of the characters hidden storylines was rich in nature and exciting but the delivery and presentation of the information? not so much. probably doesn't help that the whole notion of cheating (even if it may not be all that is seems) just ick-ed me out and i didn't like it.

overall, it was okay. what i liked from the book was the three changing perspectives part and three main girls. but otherwise, bleh.", ,

yes this is my second reread in less than a month coincidentally finishing the last day of october while i started reading this series on the 4th of october so essentially a month). i probably didnt need to do this reread after finishing oliver’s book just to get easter eggs and tidbits from the other couples in the series and yet i did :-)

still love it the most in the series, how time flows well enough (maybe slightly confusing with time skips but not confusing for too long and not jarring imo) and the character growth ! a good sucker for fake dating (though in this case not dating, but friending?) and friends to lovers trope. (though not a true friends to lovers bc the mutual attraction was there from the beginning of the book so not really but in the sense where they spend time getting to know each other deeply before even actually considering being a couple)

love it. ", ,
45,the boyfriend candidate,ashley windstead,4.25,85.00%,384,"2,023",romance,adult,October 31,November 1,2.0,"basically read in a day, consumed me, and i slept very little last night just so i could keep reading even though i had an early morning class and a huge group project to undertake with the deadline so close :D lol

i am a sucker for fake-dating and always will be. politics centered story aspect was not as appealing, but was nonetheless interesting, though minus points for the whole process and environment feeling fictionalized? (which is a bit ironic since it is a fiction book lol) idk, i guess it reminded me a lot of the process from political tv shows that i've seen and sure there's truth to both the book and those shows where the process is real. idk it's a very minor gripe and it didn't really bother me while reading but more noticing it retrospectively

further; yes i did predict the turns, yes this is a common thing (for me) that i can expect those turns, but doesn't make the whole reading story consumption process less fun or exciting. (ref: me reading 3 hours past my bedtime and getting 4 hours of sleep because of it). it truly did suck me in from the romance between logan and alexis, to the characters individually. specifically certain elements of alexis i related to and saw myself in alexis a lot, the self-doubts and fears with relationships both romantic and platonic, the feeling to put myself out there just because of societal norms and pressure, feeling like a social outcast? with traits deemed as ""shy"" or ""meek"" as if a person is just a small bug with no autonomy. but also the growth part of accepting parts of you that seem as such but also expending horizons (within comfort/reason). also in relation to that, i have a minor gripe of alexis' process of learning to love herself and be more open to receiving and accepting love (moreso romantically than familial/platonically) as it felt a bit rushed and crammed towards the end of the book and became kinda sidelined with the election closing. 

but overall, enjoyed it. it leans more on the fun and light side with fake-dating during a gubernatorial election, and less serious and emotional about the personal growth aspect which was a downside", ,
46,the decoy girlfriend,lillie vale,4.00,80.00%,304,"2,022",romance,fame/celebrity,November 2,November 4,3.0,"despite the few reviews i read before reading this book along with the average rating of this book being more mid or negative, i liked it? yes it was a bit corny and cliche-d or tropey but weirdly the sorta kitschy parts of this book made it fun? and like delving into a goofy fun not serious story. idk

i didn't see a huge problem with the insta-love between the two characters, like my brain glossed over it? my brain didn't see it as a problem so i'm noting that, no problem, again as talked in brief above, the kitschy parts were weirdly fun and exciting to read

minor gripes: 
-think that once we got to the main conflict? the leading up to the end felt very rushed and maybe certain details got pushed aside. 
-lowkey highkey wanted the conflict to be? bigger? like it was such a minor blowup for how much the characters emphasized the precariousness of things if it were to go bad
-loved the character growth for taft and freya but wished that it could've been more front and centered than just internal and talking? i don't know how that would be done but yeah

also the communication? any disagreement or grudge got resolved (maybe too well LOL) between the main couple. ideal, basically fictional levels of communication in a couple (or maybe i've been conditioned otherwise and this is just healthy uHM)

overall it was fun to read. not like a serious, ""serious"" book and facevalue it what it is. fake-dating squared in a celebrity environment (which is my guilty pleasure so) which gives me enough reason to like it even if it may not be executed in the best way. idk. ", ,
47,before i do,sophie cousens,3.75,75.00%,384,"2,022",romance,adult,November 5,November 12,8.0,"i have a lot of conflicting feelings so here’s a list of my thoughts:

the cons/negatives:
-would note a tw for divorce childhood trauma, a man making a significantly younger woman very uncomfortable and unsafe even when she says stop
-i think the way this backstory of audrey made sense for her past and future actions but doesn’t mean that it made me so uncomfortable and icky bc of this icky fucking terrible man
-how those pieces integrated was beautiful but heartbreaking, truly death by a thousand cuts
-i did not realize that this book was slow burn, especially for a book that’s about a character getting married?! and that affected my experience as i was getting impatient. 
-but in both the pacing of the book and the slow burn aspect i think it worked well but maybe not necessarily my cup of tea because it felt drawn out. all the pieces slowly came together but it was a bit agonizing during that aha

the pros/positives:
-i loved the character growth of audrey, yes it would get both frustrating and heartbreaking, but all the hurdles that she had in life without getting therapy?? poor gal
-i also love the core message of love, as a romantic yet realist girlie. how yes you can have that soulmate but also it may not be realistic to only strive for that kind of relationship in life. that there is beauty in choosing someone and growing that love and deepening that relationship 
-i also also really really loved the different timelines, all feeding tidbits of information as the story progresses and i feel like it was done well 

overall i think it ended up being a good read ", ,
48,wildfire,hannah grace,3.50,70.00%,383,"2,023",romance,adult,November 12,November 15,4.0,"i have mixed feelings. 

for the most part, reading this book was very fun and i forgot how much fun a camp-centric book was. but for the two main characters to have such heavy baggage, how they worked through it felt? like it wasn't fully formed, underwhelming. 

i did like how the two mc's were very self aware because of their emotional baggage, going into this romance was very realist? of them. and how they worked on problems because they both knew that their perceptions were skewed to start. but also how the big issues felt like they wrapped up too fast? like almost ignoring the issue, then five chapters later and now most if not all the problems were fixed? *scratches head*

all the side characters(?) were very fun and i always love a book that has these big group friendships. yes, it was a bit confusing in the beginning because it's been a bit since i've read icebreaker, and had to try and find summaries to remember who was who without mixing plots from other books with similar feeling characters lol. (also bc after icebreaker i read too many sports/hockey romances lmao) maybe a downside, how these re-emerging characters should have been introduced better?  like the pov of the mc to explain who that person was that we met before (from icebreaker). 

also the epilogue was nice, but kinda jarring. yes we get to see the HEA but also it feels sudden when we just witnessed the two characters (quickly uhm) growing from their emotional traumas. 

i thought i would rate it higher because i read it so fast and it was fun, but after re-evalutating when writing this review, the rating makes more sense to go down...", ,
49,will they or won’t they,ava wilder,4.40,88.00%,384,"2,023",romance,fame/celebrity,November 15,November 17,3.0,"first off i loved the very little tiny easter eggs from how to fake it in hollywood :)

this was very fun and emotional? to read but like in the good sense. a push and pull of an enemies to lovers that regresses and there's some whiplash especially with the flashback chapters of lilah and shane's tumultuous relationship.

at least for me, this was a first in terms of having an enemies to lovers where it was so tumultuous and push and pull relationship between the two characters. but it was fun? like emotionally intense, but fun because the up and down journey with these two and how they would end up in their hea? the journey was fun. 

the character growth was good for both shane and lilah, though the progress felt like it was happening outside, like it was behind the scenes? but for the most part it was good :)

overall very fun but also emotional and intense", ,
50,heartstopper: volume one,alice oseman,4.50,90.00%,288,"2,018",romance,teen/ya,November 18,November 18,1.0,"i did not realize how short this was, especially considering how fast i read comics/manga/webtoons and after getting to the end of chapter 1 and the book was halfway done i- 🧍‍♀️ 

sad the library doesn't have the next volume so have to figure out how i'm gonna read the next ones because this was so fun and like all the joys and fun (with a healthy realistic but not downing amount of sadness and such) of those young teen years and falling in love. from my very limited outside experience and learning from my friends' experience, the intense rushing love of teen love that feels so genuine and clean? pure? the almost young naïve part of it, and lovely that charlie has. 

very very fun and i need to read the next volume now !! >:(

also complete sidebar but this is my 50th book i have read this year and in all the years of goodreads-ing for the past 10 years i've finally finished a reading challenge (other than the one year but i ""cheated"" marking each short story in a collection that i was reading a book uh lol)

51,secretly yours,tessa bailey,3.50,70.00%,384,"2,023",romance,adult,November 19,November 21,3.0,"i think i liked this book but there were things that made it not as enjoyable or necessarily great and that docked it down. but for what the book offers, fun, kinda raunchy, childhood crush into adulthood, opposites attract romance and such, the book does deliver. 

the two main characters were fun and quirky but also weirdly human and normal in their own right? like they had their *character flaw* and it was central to the story. and while i got frustrated at the two with their *character flaw* blocking each other into miscommunication, it made sense? so it was okay. idk

what i wasn't a fan of for the main part was how quickly the conflict got resolved? like bam conflict, a timeskip that i didn't realize happened until the characters mention it and then a chapter later things are resolved and the book ends. like if it had 5 more chapter, hell maybe even 2 more it would've felt less rushed. 

and i saw another review mention this but i wanted resolution with Uncorked !! and i didn't get any after all this buildup...

but yeah. fun but maybe if i don't think about it too much, i guess.", ,
52,unfortunately yours,tessa bailey,4.00,80.00%,384,"2,023",romance,adult,November 21,November 25,5.0,"very much enjoyed reading this and i love the two main characters. doofuses and dinguses in their own right that are blind to their emotions yet still so communicative (for the most part) between each other. it's like fire vs fire but arguments or disagreements fizzle out into fiery love in surprisingly short periods. (but that's maybe just because they're <s>horny</s> in love)

the story/plot pacing and how it all laid out felt much better than secretly yours (the previous book in this ""series"" with natalie's older brother julian), which was so nice since that was my main gripe with that book. or maybe because the characters in here were chaotic but like an understandable amount of chaotic? that made sense with their character and how natalie and august talked about things with each other. maybe because of their pains and traumas they were (most of the time) very upfront with each other WHILE being in a marriage of convenience was surprising yet nice

minor side note; but how the author writes spicy scenes (at least based on both this book and hallie and julien's book) it's not my taste? to say the least. like the word choice? it throws me off every time i come across them and i have to take a breather before reading more uhhh lol. but personal preference i guess. but otherwise it's like definitely a romance novel with the amount of spice,,, but not to the point of excessive and (mostly) makes sense with the plot.. so. yeah.", ,
53,two wrongs make a right,chloe liese,4.25,85.00%,326,"2,022",romance,adult,November 25,November 28,4.0,"I think after reading this book it really cemented the fact that I like chloe's written world of emotionally complex characters that grow to love people despite their flaws and societal scars, along with their character arcs (for the most part there are exceptions or minor grievances mixed in lol)

i got so annoyed by juliet for the setup despite how much bea (and respectively jamie) did not feel ready for a relationship, and felt slightly less annoyed when i forgot that bea didn't tell her about tod (and no one in the friendgroup knew how heartbroken jamie was from his ex either). still annoying, as a person in my own shell that a small amount of pushing is fine in the long run but extensive pushing out of comfort zones (esp in the case of these characters that have mental illnesses and are not societally level of comfortable with socializing with people, moreso with unfamiliar people) but yeah...

i didn't do my normal of writing the review right after finishing the book because i had another thing to do after finishing the book and then forgot about writing the review lol so i don't have any more major thoughts.

but again. another romance novel with emotionally complex characters and character growth for the books that i really very much enjoyed reading.

also random side note but the next book in the ""series"", with the next wilmot sister and christopher, i thought it was with juliet LOL bc i forgot about kat and mixed up the names. but yeah. curious about reading that next except the library ebook is not available for another 6 months?! sadge.

54,forget me not,julie soto,4.75,95.00%,341,"2,023",romance,adult,November 28,November 30,3.0,"[yes i have an exam tomorrow and yet i spent a nearly embarrassing amount of time reading this book in the past three days lol]

i always love a wedding theme-d book and this was no exception. also the common alternating chapters in romance books except one perspective is just flashback scenes is brilliant. also the whole backstory of ama individually, having a mom that's basically on a cycle of marriages and divorces was sucky for the character but was intriguing and ?fun? to read, as it affected ama with her own relationships. along with the heavy backstory/history that ama and elliot, how that slowly trickled in through the story and we learn more and more about it

a girl loves emotionally complex characters in a romance novel :-)

but yeah i loved this book a lot and also the cover is pretty and hits the whole category of guys with tattoos uhhhhh LOL

ALSO minor spoiler but the reasoning/meaning for elliot's tattoos towards the end of the book, I yelped and screeched and nearly chucked my phone (bc it was a library ebook) into the toilet
", ,
55,the long game,elena armas,3.75,75.00%,373,"2,023",romance,sports,December 1,December 4,4.0,"I have a lot of mixed feelings

I think the main thing is that most of the pieces were there, but they just didn't fit right and maybe missing a few with pacing towards the end along the way. 

the good:
-after a few chapters, i loved cameron, maybe just because i'm a sucker for an english accent, the more english petnames (though the timing of him starting to call adalyn that kinda threw me off with the vibes between the two, really jolted the enemies to lovers flow alot). also he's fit and has tattoos?? sold (though it is kinda ""basic"" in terms of love interests character aspects but idc *shrug*)
-also re: previous point, but sports romance? always a favorite here. yes he's retired, and the main couple doesn't really play just talk about and they're more the administration side, which i was fine with? maybe after reading a large chunk of sports romance where the character(s) were actively competing in the sport vs. here where they're more leadership administration roles
-despite the kinda wonky enemies to lovers trope delivery, the slowburn? chefs kiss. i love loved it, the push and pull between the two, them slowly maybe realizing they're in love and the exchanges and banter during it? fuuun. had me giggling and smiling and nothing gets a bigger reaction to the slowburn flirt build up than that (i feel like others have also said before, but spice, stonewall reactions. flirting, the push and pull before the two mc's go into a relationship? giggling kicking my feet smiling absurdly, grinning like a fool)
-also always love a small-town setting, a la gilmore girls and many other books. the ""weird"" activities, the community all intertwined in everything is fun (within reason ofc, as long as they're not too nosey uhm)
-last thing, but always love a multiple pov book. how it changed between perspectives (mostly) flowed well and felt well-paced.

the bad/cons:
-as briefly mentioned above, for it being a enemies to lovers main trope, i feel like it delivered the least out of the core tropes that this book advertised. yes, their first encounters were enemies and hostile, but the transition from enemies to lovers was sudden and imo did not flow well. there were a couples times i just got confused, and had to stop reading for a bit just because it felt disjointed and threw me off. really cold then hot, but no transition from one to the other (if that makes sense)
-as much as i love a girlboss, adalyn being one didn't really come across as she was supposedly to be. maybe it's because we only start at the beginning of the downfall, the incidents which causes her to be kicked off to green oak, but the whole ice queen, boss-ass bitch vibe didn't come across to me. in the beginning she just seems to have attitude with no backing behind it (again maybe because she just lost power in her leadership career role, or maybe even didn't really have much power to begin with, having a snarky conniving ex-lover as a co-worker. so the whole vibe of her main ""pillar"" as a character was not sold to me). maybe would have liked more build up to the main cause of conflict with adalyn being shipped out to green oak, to establish her role with the miami flames administration. idk
-not gonna go too in-depth as it gets spoilery, but the ending felt fast? and again was confused what was happening and how certain threads would be wrapped up. the whole common last 3ish chapters wrapping the whole conflict with not only our main character but the main couple being too fast and rushed and not enough room to breathe or have things flow as it has been in the rest of the book is annoyingly common in romance books but i still hate it as a thing. and for these characters that i grew to like/love to have it happen to them? it was disappointing.

overall. i think it was good? honestly i just loved cameron LOL and i hoped this book would've been more when it kinda fell flat in some spots", ,
56,collide,bal khabra,4.50,90.00%,395,"2,023",romance,sports,December 5,December 7,3.0,"i need to sleep bc it's 4 am but yeah i loved this book
when more conscious will write more thoughts

~ it's later: 
i don't want to say it's icebreaker but better since they're two different books by two different authors and the only thing tying them together is the tropes: grumpy(f) x sunshine(m), hockey (sports) romance (probably smaller tropes too but those are the main ones)
but.... as a book that i will in this moment only define by its tropes, it is better :)

the growth of the characters, we get a good development period with both characters, though moreso on summer than aiden but we do get to see aiden break out of his bad habits(?) and being more open about his grief with summer even if they're not as present or upfront in the story as summer's trauma and bad habits.

for the most part that i remember, i think the chemistry and relationship development did not feel rushed (considering the fact that they were both physically attracted to each other but personality wise at opposite ends) or at least sudden once they started being more intimate. the push and pull, hot and cold with their relationship seemed reasonable considering summer ""doesn't do relationships"" but yet she seems to go into one with aiden (w/o labeling bc, trauma aha). and how, as summer snarks that aiden was a gentleman, saying that he won't go any further until summer admitted to herself (and aiden) her feelings under all the hard cold wall that she put up

i'm always a sucker for found family and big(ish) friend group dynamics, and with both summer's friends amara and cassidy and aiden's housemates/teammates was fun and always a thrill when they interacted. one thing, was slightly annoying that for both the guys and girls in the group that were the relegated side characters, had all these intricacies and flaws that had deeper meaning but we would never get into other than random lore drops and those plot holes or strings never got resolved. i'm assuming that since there will be another book in this universe as a sequel that one of these character pairs(?) will be the main focus and get more into their backstories. but to be teased and then shut out of it? annoying

overall, very fun. the classic sweet romance novel (with spice) and emotional under (sometimes over) tones of the character's traumas and flaws that they grow (idk what i'm saying at this point lmao)", ,
57,tis the season for revenge,morgan elizabeth,3.25,65.00%,304,"2,022",romance,adult,December 7,December 8,2.0,"it was fun, but nothing about the two main characters drew me in enough. the whole revenge to a shitty ex that used her was an intriguing and intense but fun? storyline to follow. 

i didn't know bc my ebook skipped to the first chapter so i didnt see the dedication, but i said that abbie gives major elle woods vibes, but if she was a little older, and then i missed the playlist so i went back and then got confirmation from the dedication that abbie and her initial circumstance was inspired by elle

but anyways. was fun to read. maybe not entirely for me. will probably read the next books in the series for the revenge-startingout plotlines. 

i'm proud of abbie and her growth, learning to get back her true self again and get a man that treats her like the love of his life o-o", ,
58,it happened one summer,tessa bailey,2.75,55.00%,397,"2,021",romance,adult,December 9,December 17,9.0,"as evident by how long it took to read this book, yes i was busy with studying for exams but yes it was a struggle to keep reading. i think i’ve grown to accept from reading this book that i can and should dnf books instead of grueling through it or just even skimming or skipping pages with books in general. only have so much time in life to read so many books and if it’s not for me, why take up time reading a book that i don’t enjoy? but yeah. 

i think this book affirmed that tessa bailey books are not for me. maybe because ive been reading so many romance novels for a while this year and need to move genres for more variety in my reading but also just having characters jump each other’s bones before they develop a relationship or connection emotionally is just not my vibe (and that’s okay)

but despite all that i did grow to like piper, brenden and hannah. all flawed people that learned a bit more about themselves but also the message of not changing yourself to conform and there will be people that love you for who you are (as long as those not-changes are not like harmful to them or the people around them ofc)

overall liked the character for the most part but ultimately didn’t fully enjoy it and yeah

59,hello stranger,katherine center,1.50,30.00%,323,"2,023",romance,adult,December 17,December 18,2.0,"dnf ~33%

i... really could not carry on reading it. i really wanted to especially with the premise of a portrait artist getting into an accident and becoming faceblind despite just recently gaining a huge opportunity as an artist.. but yeah, considering that i didn't like the first book of center's that i read that much, i hoped it would be at least like that,, but it aint. 

these were the last straw:

1. sadie has a shitty family with a stepmother that's condesending, and hates sadie's dead mother, her indifferent?  or distant father that disapproves of her career in art/painting instead of a doctor like him, a gaslighting, lying, manipulative stepsister that gave her trauma in high school and the parents don't believe sadie that this stepsister is like this

2. the levels of delusion that sadie has, i-..... cannot. also the whiny complaining. i could get over that and ignore it in a good book, but there was nothing else to cling to, other than finding out if she gets better from her condition, and that was simply not enough to keep going.

3. why the fuck has she been feeding her dog human food only... and not like even acceptable healthy food like steak and greens, non-kibble things that are acceptable for a dog's diet but it's pad thai?? croissants?? curry?? i simply cannot. i got too angry about it. (also that she explains this to a vet like a quirky girl with the whole ""my dog is not like other dogs"" shtick made that even more cringe)

4. a love triangle with what she views as a creep and a veterinarian that is steve rogers/clark kent personified to the point of delusional believing that she's destined to be with him like a 8 year old child with a crush and not a 30 year old woman.. 

a generous 1.5 stars rounded to 2 just bc i didn't read the whole book lol 

((yes i did skim read the rest of the book just to find out if anything happens with her dad, who she ends up with and etc. much to say i'm glad i didn't bc i would've gone insane trying to finish this book xdd)) 

for logging purposes i will put this as my read and read in 2023 shelves but do i really count it? not really lmao", ,
60,the roommate pact,allison ashley,4.00,80.00%,320,"2,023",romance,workplace,December 19,December 20,2.0,"i really loved this book

(and once i got to the acknowledgments, i was like no shot that the next book i was to read was in the same universe but yet, it is. i’ve added both books to be library reserved at different times, i think nearly weeks apart and yet the way things lined up i end up reading books that are not only from the same author, which i didnt realize but also reading the continuation/sequel to the next book i was gonna read) 

loved both graham and claire, their unique and fun personalities both separate and together. how an injury and temporary lifestyle change can bring two people closer, flowed very well. interestingly, despite their chemistry and constant making out, the author alluded to spice scenes and never included them which was surprisingly refreshing and personally not like a turn off or whatever (maybe bc ive read so many books just prior to this one where all the spice scenes were either overwhelming to keep reading them over and over or boring because of their constant occurrences.. hmm)

ive mentioned before but i always enjoy a book where the characters are complex and  have dimensional backgrounds with traumas or flaws that they work through the book (whether they learn and grow through those with their romantic interest or individually) and i think for the most part it did do so. maybe the delivery over the course of the book was not the smoothest landing, some mild turbulence if you will, to lean into the metaphor. but overall execution of the plot with the two characters going through their hurdles was endearing? heartwarming? don’t know the word but sad but encouraging and positive?

also the pacing to the end in the last 3-4 chapters felt a bit choppy? as the author was trying to wrap things together, tie the loose strings. don’t know how would to fix it but didn’t flow the best 

but yeah, maybe not like the best book but i think it was good and fun and the emotional journey (both with each other and individually) was enjoyable to read :)", ,
61,heartstopper: volume two,alice oseman,4.00,80.00%,320,"2,019",romance,teen/ya,December 27,December 27,1.0,"idk what to say it was cute and fun
", ,
62,would you rather,allison ashley,4.25,85.00%,320,"2,022",romance,workplace,December 21,December 28,8.0,"was a cute fun read, but also undercut with emotion and grief from both sides, with noah and mia. 

was in an interesting spot since ive read the technical sequel but it was nice to see claire and graham alongside the main couple. overall the characters, especially mia and noah felt very well formed?

i was supposed to write this review the day of finishing but then i went to bed and promptly forgot it until now, two days later so i don’t remember all my thoughts uhh

pacing was okay? (from what i remember) how things unraveled, from the marriage of convenience, to the emotional grief and traumas that both characters were undergoing, that pacing and way it was worked through and revealed felt okay? the antagonist and whole conflict of the book i felt meh about and kinda felt like something was missing (but again i don’t remember so maybe there was the thing that i feel now that was missing but was there uhhh lol)

overall fun book, love a good emotional character journey alongside a romance ", ,
