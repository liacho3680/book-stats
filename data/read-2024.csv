(also sidenote this new cover and the old cover differences?? the vibes they each give off are lowkey wildly different lmao)

at the end of it all, i didn't like that the male mc saw the fem mc as like helpless? in a sense. that he need to sacrifice everything for her, to the point of being unhealthy, and also kinda adding a power imbalance? on top of that, the fem mc has the tired complex of ""i don't deserve him"" just because they come from two different worlds, two very different socioeconomic backgrounds. she also had some other things that bothered me but that gets into plot things in the second half of the book that would spoil things... overall just these two idiots were at opposite ends of the spectrum in how they viewed their relationship and it just bothered me too much (not to mention that this gets ""magically"" resolved by one conversation at the last third... not to mention the rushing with tying up the loose ends one after another in a short amount of pages. ://

minor spoiler but the 3rd act did have a similar vibe to the miscommunication trope and while i don't mind it when it happens, more often than not it gives authors to speed run to the ending off of this last ditch conflict plot, and just doesn't work well.. idk man. just all of it aint for me i guess *shrug*

overall.. meh. lowkey shouldve skim read it once i got bored xdd", ,

even though it’s been nearly two years since ive started this reread as im older i didnt read much then and most of it now. was very fun and refreshing after reading so much of romance genre the past 8? months. glad to be back in this world and will continue reading. excited to get to read my favorite of the series next, the horse and his boy.

also reading this as an adult, i didnt notice but can see now the parallels with parts of the Bible??? very cool and fun to figure that out. :))

from what i remember of the series this would be in the middle? or upper third if i were to rank them i guess.", ,

still one of my favorites if not favorite chronicles of narnia book. all good parts of two new characters that the story is driven and not the main cast of characters that the book(s) have been, plus an adventure and almost spy-like mission with shashta and aravis running away from their captors into slavery (literally for one but also metaphorically with marriage for another) that also includes disguises and pretending which is thrilling and fun !

something ive noticed or realized now after finishing the “third” book (chronologically bc my edition orders it like so) in the series, is that when characters split off, we get both pov’s and what occurs for both characters without any skips which is nice and fun.

a good one.

4,gwen & art are not in love,lex croucher,4.25,85.00%,416,"2,023",romance,historical,2024-01-12,2024-01-14,3.0,"this was so cute and fun and man i just really craved a fantasy or just not modern day world and this delivered

not like a serious ""structured"" or ridged medieval world but it's a fun whimsy spin on the whole king arthur and the knights of the roundtable but also gay :))

only minor complaint is that the big conflict is essentially nonexistent in the first half than builds exponentially in the second (arguably last third of the book), as gwen's romantic feelings as well as her feud with arthur just take up the whole time of the first half. ideally would've liked more meshing with the two halves but overall not too bad *shrug*

i love loved the characters, both gwen and arthur but also the ""interests"" and side characters (love me a friend group dynamic even if it's in medieval england lol) they felt so well rounded and fleshed out, with flaws and yet vibrancy. how they all interacted throughout the book and grew in both romantic and platonic relationships was so fun and lovely and honestly heartwarming

overall very fun, liked the political undertones that lead into conflict but imo shouldve been introduced or alluded to stronger in the beginning", ,

i took a break and was re-reading the chronicles of narnia and other library books and never looked back tbh

just today i skim read the last 10 chapters, bc my god why does it drag on and i don't care about it anymore ummm yeah. (but i did skim read bc i wanted to know what happed lol)

i think i like(d) the characters and their relationships both romantic and platonic but since i lost interest in the book, that would dock major points. when i was into the book i did want to read the others in the series bc i do enjoy a book where the characters continue and each have their moment in their own book but now idek man

6,better hate than never,chloe liese,3.25,65.00%,366,"2,023",romance,adult,2024-01-15,2024-01-21,7.0,"i've enjoyed a large chunk of chloe liese's books, and loved all the characters. but these two, idk man, something just didn't quite stick with me

i think (and from other reviews i saw too) that this book felt a bit disjointed? though this is a criticism of many enemies to lovers, at least the ones ive read, how they don't feel quite as smooth with the transition from enemies to lovers. i think this book did it alright and the reason is reasonable but it felt like we as the reader found out about the discourse too late? and just the sniping back and forth for the two mc's in the beginning felt off when not knowing for a good while why. which is probably why i can only remember the book in two halves rather than a whole just because the connect didn't quite work out for me

on the other hand, i always love big friend/ (found) family dynamics and chloe always seems to deliver on that (from both the previous book in the series and also the bergman series) and i'm glad i not only got to see more tidbits of the couple from the previous book but also more about the side characters in their friend group. for the most part all of the characters both side and main felt whole and their own person with variability and such .. ( and i feel like i'm rambling xd but yeah good characters but also kate and christopher just felt like weirdly they were rushed in production? or just something was missing that made me not click with them as much)

overall, it had decent bones but just felt like there was some disconnect with why they were enemies to start idk *shrug*", ,
7,something new,lucy knisley,4.25,85.00%,292,"2,016",memoir,romance,2024-01-20,2024-01-24,5.0,"having already read kinsley's novels before, i already knew i was going to like her storytelling and art style. i liked how it was structured by the step by step process in a sense of planning a wedding, but having a narrative story through it.

the story was heartwarming, the sentiments were agreeable or interesting and made me ponder my own life and such (even if i don't see myself getting married at the moment but will happen eventually) it made me contemplate what elements i would follow that would go similarly to kinsley's experience or even compared to traditionalist wedding practices

overall, i always enjoy a good wedding story, especially wedding planning (despite the stress associated with it) and kinsley's art and storytelling was lovely to experience", ,
8,done and dusted,lyla sage,3.75,75.00%,356,"2,023",romance,western,2024-01-24,2024-01-24,1.0,"this is not the first time i've started a book at midnight (or later) and then nearly finished the book a couple hours later staying up because i got so hooked. this time is no different, with the exception of me not only finish reading the book in essentially one sitting and reading it so fast that i finished before the sun came up

much to say that this book was easy light fun read. was hooked pretty much from the get go and as a horse girl growing up this really dove into that interest aha

minor touches on heavy topics but was not the main coverage, other than emmy's anxiety after her accident. maybe would've liked to see more into it, with not only emmy but also luke, the heavier topics that linger but don't get touched that much on, other than a few key scenes. just wish that some more heavier topics or possible routes the subplots that the book could've gone through didn't, and that those potential topics didn't get glossed over or skimmed through. also another point that slightly bothered me was a couple scenes were we would get both perspectives and they didn't provide too much different information especially after having just read the other's perspective. maybe would've preferred it to happen once or twice but it happened a bit more than i would've liked.

also to further add, that i do put emphasis on a light fun read. (slight spoiler but) the plot felt smooth sailing and it really just was about emmy coming back to her hometown after not being home for awhile after her accident but not the deep emotional journey that i'd expected based on (funnily enough) other stories i've read with competitive horse riders having accidents. not saying it's a bad thing, but it is what it is, a fun read.

for those curious the spice is there and evident but the buildup was good and it made sense with the plot and chemistry and not like bam they're going at it like bunnies instantly ya know.. (would say under 4? moments if i had to count)

overall, it was nice fun and as a horse girl i enjoyed going back to the world of modern day cowgirls and cowboys :-)

and yes i will be reading the next books in this series", ,
9,prince caspian,c.s. lewis,4.00,80.00%,240,"1,951",fantasy,children,2024-01-25,2024-01-30,6.0,"it's always a pleasure to read these books and i've enjoyed my re-read of them (i think i've read this book at least 4-5 times. maybe even more)

yes i did take longer than i have for the other two books but it wasn't my lack of interest but rather phone time got sucked up and whoops it's 2 am and i should sleep type beat. finally today got to settle down and finish reading it and it twas a pleasure

in my mental ranking of prince caspian compared to the other 6 books in the series i would put it in the middleish, it's quite good but i don't enjoy it as much as horse and his boy or voyage of the dawn treader. maybe tied with last battle.

the changing pov's was nice, and the journey of having the pevensies try to connect and help caspian with his murderous uncle and reunite with aslan was exciting to read", ,
10,xoxo,axie oh,3.75,75.00%,352,"2,021",romance,fame/celebrity,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,2.0,"i picked this book up simply to fulfill a challenge in the popsugar reading challenge and maybe would’ve not heard about it or read it for a long while if at all

that’s not to discredit the book, just that after being out of high school for awhile, any high school aged story gets too awkward or cringey for me so i tend to avoid them even if the story might be good. this book did have it’s cringey or awkward moments but they weren’t overwhelming or happening so often in the book that it was tolerable? i didnt need to put down the book or anything to take a breather from the cringey ness like i do with other books haha

i really did like this story, as like me the mc is korean american, growing up in the us in a local ethnic community, having complicated relationships with your immigrant parents. because of this i did understand all the tidbits of culture sprinkled about, the food, kpop culture, etc and enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing what it is before jenny or the author would briefly explain what it is. i had also been wanting to read a boarding school recently and this satisfied that craving (though now i want to read more aha)

the main premise and meet cute was fun and lovely and cute. i related to jenny especially when i was younger feeling very rigid and sticking to the rules, not always living in the present and enjoying the moment. this also feeds into the whole fantasy of falling in love with a celebrity as a normal person and the chaos and antics that follow which is always fun. i liked that jenny also developed good friendships with other people and not just her love interest once she moved to korea, with her classmates and even the other guys in xoxo. the side characters felt developed and independent of the mc and the ml.

overall a fun read and enjoyed a story where my background was reflected with the main character", ,
11,fourth wing,rebecca yarros,4.00,80.00%,517,"2,023",romance,fantasy,2024-02-02,2024-02-03,2.0,"i went into this book with very low expectations, given the fact that it was so highly hyped as well as a large chunk of people that also strongly didn't like it.. and overall i very much enjoyed it. 

also side note but someone did mention that the use of modern-day in the technology world vernacular (a internet gaming meme if you will) threw them off in the first chapter of the book, as it is a fantasy book, having no explanation of why that language is used. once i saw that phrase in the book, it was funny to me, but i was able to ignore it and move on haha

the characters were fun, and the world was a nice place to delve into, all the themes very reminiscent of the fantasy/dystopian/other worldly books that i read when i was in middle school/high school, and it made the feeling very nostalgic (felt very much like sarah j maas' early books). i love to root our underdog protag, especially one who goes under a training arc and grows from it (in more than one way). i liked how the whole school year was this race, with checkpoints that the students would need to succeed and if they fail they essentially die (or take it again next year) and with those stakes it was thrilling, exciting to see violet challenge and ""defy the odds"" as our underdog protag making it through each hurdle. and i also enjoy strong(or growing to be) snarky mc's that some may say are whiny (all within reason sometimes it could get too much), a la celaena sardothien, clary fray, among others of the famed ya genre

the plot and how everything unfolded, from the enemies outright against violet to the further.. let's say to not spoil, details that occur was not surprising? but not like outright bad? in how it was conducted. the events and antagonists felt very common and not unique? like yeah, when a certain character or instance would come up, i would be tense as it happened but not wowed or surprised because it was so unique, i guess. i had a vague suspicion but then forgot about it as the book progressed about what had happened the last third? of the book so the shock for me was mild. 

not to like dog on the book, it was fun and maybe not your most well-constructed fantasy government world (not like a deeply profound or literary work of genius. but not every book needs to be!) or having unique plotlines and characters that twist the story, but it did envelop me in the world (i mean,, as evidenced by the fact that i read this in like a day and a half aha). it's a good fun fantasy story with no complex world building necessarily and yes it does have spice making the genre ""romantasy"" fit and make sense but that didn't hold the book back because it had it and that it wasn't excessive and made sense for the character arcs/plot. 

overall just a good fun fantasy read with no heavy complexities. also it's been a long time since i've read a book about dragons so that was very fun for me :-)", ,
12,you again,kate goldbeck,4.00,80.00%,448,"2,023",romance,contemporary,2024-02-04,2024-02-08,5.0,"i have some mixed feelings about this book but did overall enjoy it, comparatively to other enemies to lovers books, i do feel that the trope was done well and we do get to see the characters grow in their relationship from enemies to lovers.

the book was fun to read, but man the ""growing pains"" between the two characters was rough, as they're both kinda self-loathing (though that is the premise i guess, that two self-loathing miserable people find love). it took a bit to get into the story, to grow to like these two characters, both individually and together. thematically i always love a book discussing about soulmates, the perfect yet very imperfect concept of it, as well as the reconciliation of having a ""person"" with their faults and growing both as two people but together during the relationship.

having the book set in new york city, as a transplant in the city, was fun, having that tidbit of detail where i can actually visualize the location of where they were, what trains they were taking. a minor detail i guess that i like heh

overall, i think it was a solid book, having two rough characters learn and grow (sorta) through the roughness into accepting love for themselves.

13,babel,r.f. kuang,5.00,100.00%,544,"2,022",fantasy,historical,2024-02-08,2024-02-15,8.0,"i don't even know what i want to say. i went into this book pretty blind, only knowing that it was rich in detail and had heavy research from the author and it was a fantasy? academia book. and i'd say after finishing it that one doesn't need to know much more than that. (unless that doesn't convince them to read the book, so then maybe it also has themes of systemic oppression as another tidbit of info)

it was beautiful and gripping and so well researched and dense in detail and knowledge. i love the footnotes too, not only adding definitions but would also have little side notes about the characters. the world felt so alive and rich, all in its glory and despair at the same time. as an academic and also minority, though the present times are (maybe) better now compared to then specifically in the book, i empathized with robin and the others with the oppression and difficult circumstances that they faced. the main core characters were so complex and real, with their positive and very strong negatives that imo was clear to me. the morally grey-ness that they all each had, trying to figure out the meaning of justice and freedom. the core of story if all simmered down is about empathy, and as a person that greatly values empathy in a person, i did enjoy? that aspect of the book.

hauntingly powerful book, giving questions about equality and race and the act of translating, not just words but also meaning and understanding across languages, nations, peoples that are still relevant even in the present time.

sidenote: this felt like a breath of fresh air after reading (still good but a different kind of good compared to this book good) books that were fun but maybe didn't have the deepest in substance. a nice balance and such. and now i shall read a light book even though i have a secret history next because i don't think i could do two heavy books in a row lmao

i think the romance overall was good? and the whole enemies to lovers was okay? i guess. the conflict points was very common romance plot points and how they were carried out was, let’s say how i don’t want relationship starting and conflict to happen is the best way i can describe it lmao. 

also personally not that interested in guys with long hair uh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so rhett didn’t have much to start with for me. summer and her people pleasing tendencies which was something i could somewhat relate to along with her having family trauma? that she held onto and how that resolved was alright? not the greatest but not sure how it could have been both revealed and resolved better.

wasnt crazy about the age gap between willa and cade, the 13 yr age gap, as a person that doesnt like 10+ yr age gaps (the only minor exception being that they’re both in the same life stage). in this case was able to move mostly past it as willa was 25 and decently established in her career (sorta) before she meets cade, making them technically be in the same life stage, so mild pass for me ig

enjoyed the whole storyline of willa taking care of lucas as a maternal/female figure in lucas’ life after his mom walked out on him. their close friendship and bond was really cute and i approve of the whole treating kids like little adults, with respect and communication

did not like certain plot points as the story continued, the 3rd act conflict and all that. couldve been done better imo

but anyways i really really enjoyed this story, the world was fascinating and got me hooked from the start. the moral complexities that rowan and citra face and grapple with through their training to become a scythe. 

scythe curie was one of my favorites, and the insight and simply put, her role in the story was fun and interesting. how the story unfolded, keeping the reader just in the dark as rowan and citra were at points, to slowly reveal tidbits and piece by piece, just made the story pacing great here.

i dont know what else to say, i feel like going into this book with little detail made the experience of it all the more exciting and gripping with all the details that you gain. and now i really really want to read thunderhead but i have to wait two months for my ebook library hold to come through ://///", ,

i think it was fun for what it was, the slow burn was a little too long for me (at the time, but i think decently executed for a slow burn) wish we got to see more of sloane ballet dancing, but i understand for her character arc and the relationships surrounding it, why it wasn't that prominent in the story... or maybe that's just indicative of the lack of character development both individually and together as a couple.. hmmge. we did see glimpses of character personality and development, but then just get shoved into a confrontation or just them fucking (or both xd) so... yeah...

i dunno what else to say, it was fun and alright but i would maybe say there are better hockey romances out there (oh! the hockey wasn't even that prominent lmao, moreso a weird sports romance in a cowboy romance but had neither of those prominent or the main focus so the tone? or vibe of the story didn't lean into either of those tropes that much) so it didn't even have like a trope for me to cling to with the story, as with the other two books had at least that xdd", ,

the whole pregnancy trope did not go how i expected (but once i realized it wasn't going that way i did kinda predict what would happen, which is fine). i think out of all the books i feel like winter and theo had the most character development that we get to see? and the growth from it? still would've liked to see more of the character, but maybe because it was wrapping up strings with their relationships with other characters from previous books it felt like it had more character dev? idk

minor personal gripe that these books have is a lot of spice but not as much plot as i would like, though this book despite the same amount of spice, did have a good enough level of plot for me to enjoy and become invested? interested? to know how things would resolve with the conflicts both with each mc separately and together in their relationship

overall it was fun, for me the best out of the series. 

no i will not be reading the next book bc i cannot read books with big character age gaps, esp that the fem mc is 22 in the book and the dude's 13 years older. i could maybe get by (as i did with the second book) if the youngest is at least into adulthood in their late 20's but that's a strong maybe", ,

but i was able to get used to the lack of quotation marks and get into the book for the most part and really grew to like marianne and connell. i appreciated the complexities that the two had, how flawed and within their own heads they were. felt realistic how people are, as per the title “normal people,” all with both light and dark parts of their lives, how get into our heads, bad communication or too much communication (that can become bad communication) 

i liked how we had time jumps between chapters, like we get glimpses into marianne and connell’s lives and their relationship to each other over the course of school and university. as mentioned my main negative is that i do wish we could have more about the character, felt like we were just a little under the surface of them.

i can't quite put my finger on it, but i did see someone's review say how one note? the plot was, and i think i can agree, that at least it was just one plot line going. and at the time of release, sure that would have been good enough, but nowadays, even with those sequels of popular books how those plotlines in later books have become more nuanced. i don't know, maybe that's just the crux of having read so many books that how plotlines go, they can eventually seem predictable and/or inevitable.

the whole premise but also execution, i felt was done well (for the most part, not too predictable but inevitable). how much eve was handling the change even if it was a bit bumpy and confusing for her for parts of it. liked the messaging of how much one can change with big life changes, such as pregnancy, and also the hindsight too, how the people we interacted and how we felt in the past had led us up to now, in a more content but could still be chaotic time. 

i enjoyed the characters, not just eve and her two love interests(?) ethan and shep but also willa and isamu(i forgot how to spell it) yes they are messy and complicated and ethan especially is a jerk but how more complex they feel? and human in their relationships. but that's what i enjoyed about them, that eve was not only navigating an unplanned pregnancy but also her love life between this guy that she only just clicked that she maybe has feeling for or her baby daddy, along with a lifelong friendship with willa that gets complicated because willa has been struggling with pregnancy herself. 

the plot's quite simple to be fair, and even though there are wrenches thrown in here and there, it's not too surprising, but not overly (imo) predictable. it was fun and i needed a nice chill easy read inbetween the non-fiction and short stories and ya dystopian that's dragging a bit haha ", ,

but, as a person that enjoys sports romance, i would've liked to have more of either mike's hockey or aurora's ballet/dance in the story. 

the personal character growth for both mike and aurora was nice to see, especially with how the book was paced, skipping in time, we got to see the progress over the course of a year or so. that said, was not crazy about the time skips, some made sense but others felt like it was pushing the story along too fast, not getting enough time in that moment and was just being told what happened in that time. idk

but that being said i did like the friends that both aurora and mike had, supportive through their dark times with parents/inlaws and going to therapy. but also, not that i know how i would change it, but the conflict would always resolve so quickly? other than the big one at the end, and even then it did but i felt like i was given the payoff so quickly from the conflict throughout the book and it felt too smooth sailing all the time... just personally wouldve liked maybe a little more conflict or the disagreement to last a bit longer?

i think those are my main feelings? without getting into much detail that would lead to spoilers but yeah.

fun fact(?) but i started the 3rd book after shadow and bone thinking it was the 2nd book and i was so confused with the prologue where the book was going lmao. only realized when i was trying to add it on my goodreads that i skipped a book xdd

yes, it did have some slow moments between the conflicts but i felt that those were justified to set up those conflicts and tension, even if they were a bit annoyingly slow and drag-y

overall fun? has slightly more complex plotlines with more than just the two teams of “bad guys” and “good guys” even if there was some teaming up i guess. but there are still dumb teenage personalities at play so yeah

i did enjoy reading, and read fast to find out how alina will face against the darkling, very intense but also not fully satisfied with the ending? like i get it, but also i wished it was a bit more grim and less HEA-feeling. 

the big reveal (that i will not discuss in more detail other than the big reveal) felt like it was delivered well? at least the lead up into it. how it was revealed was kinda just done plainly and i had to re-read the page to realize what was going on. meh

one thing, in hindsight was the worldbuilding, not just in this book but in the series felt strong. the landscapes and politics were evident enough (or maybe i have low expectations for a ya fantasy lmao) maybe bc i'm a person of detail, i liked the details that bardugo gave, while other review did mention how the worldbuilding was a bit tedious (which i can understand and feel to some extent)

i liked in this book how we got to know the characters more, a large chunk being just introduced in the second book. not only more developed and whole, but also developing those relationship dynamics in the ""main"" group. 
i am still very confused (but can see the reasoning after reading other reviews and reddit threads lMAO) why people simp over the darkling and even moreso ship him with alina. but also?? he is a still a toxic manipulative violent man?? hello?? (re: i have noticed that people like him mainly from the influence of the tv show and the actor being attractive... which is still weird imo but okay, ig) i do like their relationship as the heroine vs the villain, with the added dynamic of ""they are the only two people to understand each other and their powers"" yadda which i do like that facet of. i did not like how we were pushed into this pseudo fake-out love triangle, and then also lowkey a love square? with mal, the darkling, and nikolai. (though technically it would just make an E shape since no mlm eerm lol)
i get that mal can seem boring, especially in a fantasy world but c'mon? despite the distance between alina and mal that grew since we first met them, how they navigate the space and their changing relationship (romantic/platonic etc) was interesting to read. 

overall i think it was fun and good and i felt satisfied with how it tied the loose ends to what was left off in book 2. the adventure and journey was great fun to read and the battle was intense? and also feel satisfied with the whole of it. i still like book 2 the most in this trilogy (by like a teeny quarter star rating) and i will be reading six of crows duology and maybe the duology after, as the world is fun and easter eggs and past book/series references are my favorite heh", ,

but it’s been a month since i’ve read scythe so the cliffhanger of that subsided but nonetheless the book was still very enjoyable even if i didn’t get to read it right after finishing the first book because i was waiting for a library hold 

i much enjoyed the pacing of the book, how each layer and detail was slowly (maybe painstakingly) revealed. the changing of pov’s and just the general vibe of the book having 3rd person omniscient was something that i really enjoyed and felt this book has done well with. we get to know details before the characters know but also certain pieces only revealed as the character finds out as well, because we jumped from one pov to another. 

i really got to enjoy hanging out? learning more about scythe marie curie through scythe anastasia/citra. also the development of relationship between the two, how the mentor/mentee relationship grows, and the closeness that they have. anastasia/citra learning more about being a scythe while working with marie curie, but also the conflict with rowan at the same time.

don’t want to speak on spoilers so i’ll just say this, but i have a lot of questions and am very curious as to what happens with the scythedom with this new information and all that unraveled in the last chapter

27,the rule book,sarah adams,3.50,70.00%,356,"2,024",romance,sports,2024-04-10,2024-04-11,2.0,"i felt so heavy after reading many intense fantasy dystopian books and since my library rental on this ebook was gonna end in within a week i decided why not for a fun little break

but i did like this book more than the cheat sheet, the sorta predecessor to this book. still was cheesy and cutesy and i can definitely see people cringing (myself included) at nora's -isms and quips but for the most part they were tolerable and might i even say enjoyable? to an extent.

the book was silly fun and the fake dating trope was sprinkled in there but maybe because i read through the book fast but it felt like it was barely there and would've liked more from it. the ex lovers trope was alright too, it had the tension but then it went away pretty fast once the two reconnected and i would've liked to have more drawn out tension idek

the plot was.. mid to say the least. as with many romance novels, this was also character/relationship driven and it was so close to being a very solid? not always smooth sailing one but it was swerve and miss more intentional interesting plot. i did like how both derek and norah were very whole people with flaws and quirks and a personality (even though they did feel like they were missing something but idk what exactly. missing some minor thing) maybe if it went more into both of their messy childhoods and how that affected them as people would've been the final piece that i feel like is missing. because those tidbits almost felt like plothole because they were brought up enough for it to mean something, other than excuse of norah and derek excusing for their messy qualities. was disappointed that they weren't more important plot points. 

overall it was fun but the book was very much sunshine and rainbows and wouldve liked to have more conflict and plotline beyond just the main one of ""hey we were exes that broke up messily and are now forced to work together""", ,

i truly love the complexities that shusterman did with all his characters here, how they were introduced, and lead into the story, tidbits gradually told to the point of it being near painful to be patient for the plot arcs to take shape. but at the same time, i liked that we got to spend time with the main players, even the antagonist goddard, learning more about them at that current point and how their personal plans were unfolding all at the same time.

i liked how it wrapped up, as the final book in the trilogy, tying loose ends, having a satisfying ending that is mainly positive but also has that point of realism? or at least it not being the perfect ending, but peaceful.

i don't know what else to say, my spring allergies are acting up right as i'm writing this and my mind is distracted on that instead of my thoughts ermm so yeah it was fun, a bit slow which docked a quarter star compared to scythe and thunderhead because of the pacing. it was intense but had a good resolution", ,

wes and ada, love them, their flaws and insecurities as well as their strengths and how they (sorta) grew in this book with their character arcs.

similar to the first book, but i wasn’t crazy with the fact that we get important details about the two main characters flaws to have them not be resolved in the book (maybe could argue the fmc does but definitely not the mmc). the author really does tease the emotional vulnerability to just not get into them??? bruh. like i wouldve liked more details about chance (ada’s ex husband) other than the snippets we get in passing. and also the heavy burden that wes deals with being the middle child and feeling overlooked and feeling the need to prove himself (even if he doesn’t have to)… just ugh my mild frustration that it doesn’t come through

also the pacing? felt a bit fast and skim-y like time was moving but i don’t get to interact or get a better feel of the characters, both main and side characters, especially during the renovation period, those june-july days sped by so fast, and wished i could’ve had more detail and just more time to sit with it for a bit before moving on..

also the little tidbits we get about the renovation was fun but man i wanted more ! i think this is more of a personal preference, what was in the book was solid but my little interior decorating/reno heart wanted more to read about 3

but i really love love loved this so much. it had a lot of elements that i enjoy in a romance, the development of characters that are complex and have some baggage that they grow with throughout the book and it did truly deliver. i loved the quirkyness of the premise, of how justin and emma met through an aita reddit thread and the flirting and jokes they had that connected them from the start. their whole dynamic was sweet and cute, and personally not cheesy to me, just the right level of of cheesy? quirky? to be endearing and sweet. 

the whole undercurrent/conflict for both justin and emma was done well, at some points i even forgot that amber was supposed to be a conflict just because i was distracted by cute moments from emma and justin and threw me in for a loop (in the good way). how real? that felt. that one moment everything feels fine, perfect even, then the shoe drops and throws you, scrambling to try and take control of the wheel again. the whole element of growth? and emotional entanglement and trauma felt (from the little, basic human knowledge that i have) felt so realistic and grounded, added a good foil to the romance aspects of the book. 

i think the whole relationship dynamics and tension not only between emma and justin, but also with their mom's, really captivated me and spurred me on to keep reading. there were certain points that maybe things felt a bit flat like in terms of descriptions and needing more words, but at key moments with the plot points it was all clear in my head so ultimately it was fine for me? 

other than the vague premise with no prior series knowledge, (i did not know until the author's q&a in the back of the book that this was not amber nor neil's first appearance. which shall be an interesting experience once i start to read part of your world soon) i had much fun with this. i liked the balance of romance and fun cutesy-ness with the harsh reality and trauma of fractured families. both not detracting from the other, but not outshining either.

32,funny story,emily henry,4.25,85.00%,395,"2,024",romance,contemporary,2024-04-30,2024-05-03,4.0,"waaaa another emily henry book that releases in the end of april :^)

and yes another heroine that i can relate to, parts of me both in the past and present. the more ""meek"" and shy or reserved, girl who loves books and who also gets emotional and doesn't have a good time making friends nor keeping them :| whoop

but in all honesty this was emotional and endearing to read, but i still hold book lovers and happy place much higher in the nonexistent tier list of emily henry books. right now i'm thinking of that meme? comment about how author's always have their protags be authors, in the publishing industry, or librarians and yes this book does fall into that trope? fallback? but yeah. i think maybe because i've been anticipating this book much longer than any other emily henry book so i had undetermined expectations? and this book mostly delivered but not in the way that i would've necessarily liked i guess. i can't put my finger on it, but something was off. the emotional conflict that daphne had was mostly tied, enough to satisfy me, and miles's conflict was touched upon enough but maybe was glossed over and wasn't given enough attention? but then again this book was only in daphne's pov so we only could get so much emotional growth perspective other than what daphne gets from miles or his sister.

pacing was alright? did feel like certain parts we could've scoped more into. or even just the whole wedding that daphne was supposed to have with peter that fell apart. or maybe if the book started right then? instead of later when she's already moved in with miles? idk. but also how the whole story was laid out felt a bit off? but i can't really put my finger on why. now looking back, it did feel like the whole timeline from marriage breaking off to the end of the book, the plot points were mostly solid but didn't fully hit the mark every time. (i keep rambling bc i'm trying to rack my brain for a more clear reasoning as to why it felt off erm)

when the big conflict happened (no details bc spoilers) it really did make me tear up, not sure because of my period or also just recently feeling down but that big moment/conflict happened really hit me for some reason, moreso than it probably would normally. also weirdly felt like a good chunk of songs from taylor swift's new album the tortured poets department (at the time of writing this review) really did fit as a soundtrack to this book. not all the song's themes matched but it sorta did in some aspects which also added another emotional layer having more than one medium of romance hitting at different levels (trying to describe this w/o spoiling what happens haha)

i enjoyed the small town environment, and as a person that grew up in the midwest certain details made me laugh or reminisce because of the characters going to a place similar to a place i could think of in real life. maybe because daphne was so not integrated? into the town, just floating through on her own, not forming relationships or even just exploring (which, relatable, especially younger me that would just go from school to home and nothing else until adulthood where i started to do so sorta). but because of that i understand why we didn't get to get more details of the world? but still would've like a bit more.

but yeah. i think there was something off with the pacing and maybe having more details? at certain points just because certain points. but was fun and emotional to read. and another book that gives me the urge to just live in a small town working with books and going to farmer's markets man....

man, this book was so emotionally heavy. probably because of the themes, of domestic abuse, of classism and elitism, of familial oppression and abuse. from my small scope of experience and knowledge, i did feel that the author handled these topics well. i think how the conflicts that were related to these themes were not dealt with cringey-ness or being corny or treated like a messy stereotype. that being said, it did feel a bit too even keeled, with therapy knowledge and the fact that we meet alexis after she left neil and after she had already been going to therapy for a bit. maybe would’ve liked it more if we got to be with alexis during that period, idk

pacing of the book was okay, felt that towards the end, it wrapped things up a bit too quickly? a lot was happening in the last few chapters and i feel like it could’ve been spaced out more? or just given another chapter to breathe. in both meeting and towards the end, alexis and daniel’s relationship felt like it was going too fast and as some people like to say, it did lean towards insta-love but idk the hooking up to meaning something more made sense? but very rom-com esque and not necessarily the more common irl relationship path

i always enjoy stories in small towns, the fun light yet maybe heavy undertones with a cast of characters that all (usually) look out for each other. excited to continue reading and maybe hopefully get to know more of the town in the next book

overall was a good book, it was emotionally heavy but dealt with those topics well. felt like we didnt get much outside of daniel and alexis’s relationship and i would’ve liked more in that aspect. ", ,
34,yours truly,abby jimenez,4.50,90.00%,416,"2,023",romance,workplace,2024-05-05,2024-05-07,3.0,"i really really liked this book. fake dating (sorta) and both mc's are doctors which is a genre that lately i've been getting into, especially with reading the books in this series

the miscommunication is so so strong in this book but it makes sense for the characters with male figure trauma and anxiety and overthinking. i think it also helps that i havent read a book with much miscommunication recently until this one, and also not it just being the last bump in the road in the plot but rather a consistent conflict that crops up so it feels better? maybe because it's not 3rd act miscommunication, but rather a consistent thing that the two mc's are dealing with makes it acceptable? personally was happy with how tonally it was, but can see this being a bad/not great aspect of the book's plot.

i think with this miscommunication, it really added something to both jacob and bri's character arcs. how they had and still have these burdens that they are struggling through, with trust, with acceptance, and learning to navigate that both individually and together. i enjoyed the humor between the two, how that broke the ice in more tense situations but also just in relationship development. i really related to jacob in many aspects, though i don't have anxiety, but i do empathize with the cycles and downward spiral of overthinking interactions, how planning ahead to expect certain decisions to be already made from the planning, enjoying a quiet night and not a wild night on the town in loud dance clubs and finding comfort in pets. 

pacing of the book felt good? i think how the conflict was unfolding felt like it was going at the right speed, and how we get to learn more about jacob and bri as times moves on

my brain is blank idek what else to say i just really liked it lmaoo. but also jacob's house sounds like a dream, other than not having a couch LOL the reading spot, the PLANT ROOM?! that's temperature/humidity gaged... i should get more plants hmm

also damn that situation with amy and jeremiah, jacob's ex and little brother getting married a few months after jacob and amy broke up is fucked. even IF there was no cheating, or anything, still, like wait at least a year man... courtesy and all that

overall was what i enjoy in romance novels, the fun cutesy romance but also the emotional aspect, navigating traumas, hangups, personal demons etc. rating is weighed a little bit higher, even though it may not be like a lifechanging, inspirational, unique book. just because i enjoyed it so much and read it within like 36 hours essentially :]

the first swing
o wow a poem to start?? but was good. free verse(?) and i liked the thematic element in relation to scythes, how it’s law to them to kill, to be this ominous figure to sorta carry out the law, their duty. this poem also read like a chant, again with the whole ominous figurehead feeling from this.
4 stars

formidable
we finally get the story of marie! and how the role she played with the last remaining government in the us during the transition of mortal age to the thunderhead’s era. interesting to read about her thoughts and feelings as she’s quite young, like scythe anastasia in the beginning, being maybe naive but wanting to appear calm and wise, living in simplicity but also adjusting to the high status of being a scythe. 
4.25 stars

never work with animals
interesting. i do like it that it sorta centers around dogs. how the story slowly meanders and reveals how much the story is emphasized on dogs with scythe fields. amusing but interesting.

a death of many colors
interesting. guess makes sense naturally that people would believe that the thunderhead is fake or scythes are fake, as with many truths in real life that people, no matter how much evidence is provided, that they choose to still not understand/believe
3.75 stars

unsavory row
well alright. it felt like a half extension story to a character, as it’s about the sibling of the guy that got gleaned when we first meet rowan. not sure if it’s any substantial story and maybe because the whole paradox of unsavories in relation to the thunderhead didn’t particularly interest me in the main trilogy so this didn’t either?
3 stars

a martian minute
and here we are, goddard’s backstory. he indeed was human with regret before he became the series antagonist. almost sympathetic? towards carson, how he felt trapped and all the ambition, though misplaced with bad intentions, was thwarted by his parents keeping him on mars instead of going back to earth. we also get to see some elements of his personality that would mature into what we saw in the main series and was cool to see how that ambition, almost blindingly lead him to the steps, steps that would be essentially burning his conscious because of the great moral breaking he was doing. 
4 stars

the mortal canvas
…i think this one might be my favorite. the whole premise from the start intrigued me, curious as to how it would end, something that hindsight makes sense but i wouldn’t have expected it. the beauty in mortality and death, specifically within art was an interesting experience to have with the characters, moreso because they had death (potentially) looming towards them. the emotion that morty had, through all the ups and downs of this final project. there was also interesting commentary on new art styles, digital art, and present day (reading in may 2024, though this story was published a bit ago when this wasn’t as prevalent or even existent conversation ) art arguments/conversations about ai art and generative ai and it’s affect on art these days. 
4.5 stars 

cirri
sort of melancholy, but interesting nonetheless. a sort of continuation right after the end of the trilogy, with the cirri how they watch the humans on board each their ships, some already not making due to conflict, human or otherwise. almost poetic feeling with how we reflect life and death, how one error and lead to detonation and death
4 stars

anastasia’s shadow
interesting. mixed feelings with the main plot but in context to the trilogy it makes sense with the characters that reappear from the trilogy making decisions. it was like parts of scythe except more melancholy because of the reasoning even if the training arc was fun? how much ben was suffering adds that tone to it. did really like how poetic the ending was.

but man, the characters felt so, awkward? just too cringey for me, how emmy's internal monologue and thoughts with how she phrased things were too cringey and almost not real sounding? at least in my opinion. i also dislike how the tension between emmy and grayson from the start of the novel kinda just dissolved with no important plot involvement? like huh?? and even the reasoning as to why emmy hated grayson's guts was weak but chalked it up to young teen drama (and classic, to find out it was only one-sided. but that whole miscommunication wasn't even addressed between the two ugh)

also it did have the 3rd act conflict but it was set up so poorly and wish at least elements of it was more involved earlier in the story. and! not to mention! the resolution of that conflict felt like such a slap job and no communication other than the simple i'm sorry, i jumped to conclusions. a minor success was that they [non-gendered for nonspoilers] didn't forgive the other right away and start jumping each others bones, but don't worry that happened in the next chapter with not much else that happened :///

i figured after a couple chapters that it wasn't gonna be like an amazing romance novel but i was hoping for cheap fun thrills but barely even got that imo :// was gonna rate it a 3.5 stars or even 3.75 stars but now looking back at my time reading the book, it wasn't that much fun to warrant more partial stars so it got docked partial stars. sucks, really wanted to enjoy it with the whole premise.

i think from the start, i felt so satisfied with ziggy's story, so to now get to the final book with viggo, a guy that just felt like too much (as a side character in the other books) i already had meh feelings about him. that coupled with the main themes/tropes of enemies to lovers (that didn't really feel like it imo), love-traumatized character, and forced roommates (though in other contexts fine with, but this combo just didn't do it for me). don't get me wrong, i think chloe liese's quality in storytelling didn't go down, just that the characters and plot points didn't vibe with me (not to mention the slow boredom? or break that i need from romance because the fuel of burning through romance books has fizzled out during the read of this book)

surprisingly i have issues with the bergman sibling to have less character dimension and growth during the book in previous series (from what i remember it's been awhile in terms of books so it's not fresh in my mind), and the so to have more character development since they're the *new* person in this world. but interestingly this was the case where i felt like tallulah was the more undeveloped compared to viggo. other than her personal internal trudge through love-trauma from her parents, the momentous things of her growth to becoming open to love again felt like they didn't happen in action, but rather more glossed over or told to us. and then bam moving fast and felt like maybe i was missing something? not too sure. 

also wished that the heavy topics that were talked about were better dealt with? i think they were okay in the book but wished it could've gone more into it than more brief stop on it before moving on quite quickly. i think that the relationship growth between tallulah and viggo did happen, but we as the readers felt like we were left out of chunks of it that would make it timeline wise, make more sense with the steady growth instead of more jumps between time jumps.

not much else to say, just that i lost interest in the book, and only finished just bc i like the burgman family </3 

but man romance book burnout(?) hit hard on top of the gripes i had with the book, making me lose reading momentum, thus influencing my end rating to be a lot lower than expected. ", ,

honestly i would've read this book in a shorter time, but the couple month delay was not only due to my library copy expiring but also emotionally was rough as at the time, someone in my family had a medical scare and the thematic elements of michelle going through her mother's cancer felt all to real and too much at the time. but after the scare was indeed a scare, and i got another library ebook copy, i finally finished reading

i enjoyed this a lot. the emotional journey of not only growing up in the us with a korean identity but juggling assimilation with being ""more american."" personally am not mixed like michelle, but that conflict of balancing cultural acceptance from both sides, i do relate to and emphathize. the food mentioned, how certain mannerisms or phrases commonly used felt so relatable and comforting to find someone else having that similar korean-american experience. 

i also related a lot to michelle's experience with her mom being diagnosed and having cancer, leading to passing away. though i am grateful to have not experienced my parents passing, i've had close family members, even my maternal grandmother whom i was extremely close to growing up, pass to cancer and how that affects you both at the time but also much later. 

the topics/themes were delivered very well, and the pacing felt natural. each chapter felt almost like an essay, with a narrative story to exemplify that moment to be highlighted in michelle's life at the time. i laughed, i cried, i was happy, i was gut wrenched, all those emotions from witnessing such an emotional time period in the author's life. the beauty and devastation during all of it.

overall i really enjoyed it. and now i wanna go eat korean food... haha",,

i don't think the plot line and character arcs were particularly groundbreaking or new, but it was fun and i enjoyed it. and not all books need to be as such. :)  but my goodness the levels of delusion and denial that this girl was in... can definitely see how that would be annoying for some people but was just amusing to read and see what wild mental goose chase ellie would go on, to the point of maybe going in over her head and ruining things that she was trying to do.. aha

one nitpick was that the pacing from the second half to the end felt very fast and rushed, like things were moving, and the 3rd act conflict and resolution happened in the last like three chapters and i always dislike that in books </3 also would've liked to see more family dynamics on ellie's side, even just more dinners or such, as it just felt like we were only convincing theo's side and for a character that has such strong ties and feelings about family, we didn't get much scenes of them in the book. (yes not to get into spoilers but there is a reason why ellie's side of the family didn't need to meet theo as much as his side but still would've liked it for more realism and just making sense and development :/ )

40,iron flame,rebecca yarros,3.50,70.00%,640,"2,023",romance,fantasy,2024-05-31,2024-06-03,4.0,"i have/had a lot of thoughts but not all of them are coming to mind right now... erm

but much to say that things have not improved per say from the first book. doesn't mean that i won't be reading the next book (probably the series too tbh) but that it has its faults and there are definitely other high fantasy books that plot and character wise are stronger

that being said, i did enjoy (for the most part) reading this book. i love and always will love found family dynamics, and the relationships between violet, her squad, and others that we later get to know more was very fun and thrilling. the reason as to how i was able to plow through this book so quickly was because i needed to read more of the dynamics, how they would navigate through different struggles and conflicts, hell even if they survive (it is a 5 book series, i believe so surely there are players since the first book that would last and carry through to the end.. right? i say as past fantasy series that i've read don't have many people... survive... erm)

but now finishing the book and looking back, i think plot wise was more interesting? as the first book was more magic school initiation type beat while this leans into rebellion revolution war politics. though, would've liked to see more of that and felt almost like violet was left out of conversations or only hearing summaries or tidbits due to avoiding putting more intricacy or development on the political war front. just a thought. but i think the pacing was good, and for what was revealed and how, felt at the right tempo, and for the most part didn't drag too much or speed up either.

i do very much dislike how violet and xaden's relationship problems kept cropping up, and persistently not changing or improving, honestly for basically the whole book. it almost felt like it was detracting from the main story of the rebellion and the issue with the venin, constantly right before important moments just to try and address (and fail) their trust issues. having catriona was..   interesting for their relationship especially during a tumultuous time. i don't hate how that whole storyline was delivered, but again, going back to the same issues, that even the characters are aware of the constant back and forth, with no progress was frustrating?  and i just wanted to move on. like yes the new wyvern and venin was the big plot of this book but honestly these relationship issues seem to rival being the main conflict and plot device of the entire book ://

not to spoil what exactly happens at the end, but i kinda guessed in what direction it would lead (not to mention that i was getting impatient with the whole storyline with andarna and went to the fan wiki page to jump ahead and learn more lmao and in the process spoiled a detail that would be revealed at the end as a cliffhanger oops) very much reminiscent of other fantasy-esque books that i've read with how the plot seemed to be leading. also. whenever a book that has been only one pov since its start and suddenly changes pov's.... it gonna get.. insane. for the characters.. let's just say..

overall the book was fun, but it very much feels like those first books of fantasy books i grew up with with annoying details or plot issues that i don't care enough about to really savor a book... but i do tend to have a preference for middle of series books so hopefully i'll like the next one better (but it has to have more politics c'mon mann)", ,
41,better than the movies,lynn painter,4.25,85.00%,356,"2,021",romance,teen/ya,2024-06-04,2024-06-05,2.0,"i was apprehensive when i first started. as i've gotten older, books that take place in modern day high school inherently just feel cringey to me, on top of not wanting to relive high school again through the book aha. but was glad that though liz is a bit cringey, she's also cute and sentimental (maybe to a fault). 

the biggest part that was cringey or awkward to read was liz's infatuation with michael, or rather the idea of him. probably due to being tied with grief about her mom, as to why she clung to that idea and never really moved on or grew up from it. i sympathized with her and accepted this aspect of her personality because of that background detail

the whole plot of it taking so long for liz to realize what she thinks she has with michael vs what she has with wes was a journey but was fun (yet can be frustrating) to witness. but damn girl it took so long to get into her head and things to click into place. also this book does have miscommunication in the conflicts, but more so just the two characters not talking !! even though they should !! but they're silly high school teens that have bad communication skills xd

overall this book was very cute and fun and a fast read. the cringe was there but it's a level of cringe with reasoning as to why its cringe that made it tolerable/ignorable", ,
42,how to end a love story,yulin kuang,4.50,90.00%,384,"2,024",romance,fame/celebrity,2024-06-06,2024-06-10,5.0,"i started this book but then changed my mind and wanted to read fantasy so i started throne of glass, cut to a couple days ago, realizing that this ebook from the library is due very soon and i had only read a couple chapters before putting it down (not that it was bad just that i was at the time more interested in reading something else) but man, once i started, i was sucked in. i spent three nights in a row going to bed very very late and subsequently ruining my sleep schedule just because i was so sucked into reading this. 

first the premise. was very curious how it would play out and was not disappointed. the tension and almost enemies to lovers energy it had but having a more serious tragic circumstance that made them (more so helen than grant) feel so hostile to the other. 

i felt like the pacing was solid, maybe at certain points it felt a bit rushed and time was moving too fast where we would just get a simple summary of what happened in the time skip which i'm not always crazy about in books (not that i need to know everything that happens but i feel like at somewhat important or meaningful moments get cut for brevity). i liked that we got both pov's of helen and grant, but the split wasn't your traditional romance book of one chapter one pov next chapter other pov. it was very fluid and went back and forth. yes at first it was something to get used to but once i did i really enjoyed it. it was different and had that more cerebral stream of consciousness feeling to it with this style. learning about kuang's background as a screenwriter once i finished the book felt it made more sense with this choice.

i love love romance books that have roots in realism, addressing the emotional tenets of the characters since their relationship is the main plot point of the story. i feel the characterization was done well, how almost frustratingly both helen and grant were stubborn in their own ways not understanding or communicating during their issues and more specifically helen's hangups about not wanting anything love-related with grant (even though she ain't fooling anyone just silly to not realize and admit it). i felt the aspects of the asian american assimilation experience to be very relatable, the complex relationship one has with their parents, how the concept of love was a very tricky and unclear sentiment growing up and specifically in helen's case how that coupled with michelle's death created some heavy trauma and emotional complexities that only during the book she would start to tackle more. 

not to get into spoilers but i also enjoyed the ending, how things did not resolve perfectly and again had that realism of disagreements may not be resolved, especially whilst having a language/culture barrier making the circumstance all the more complicated. 

the level of spice/sex scenes in the book felt a little too much for my personal preference but i think that they all made sense and wasn't an excessive like hump fest that made no sense to the plot or character arcs, a thing that i often get annoyed by in other romance novels (ofc personal preference, like things to have meaning and contribute to the plot, rather than just to have them in a book)

overall i really enjoyed this one. how it touches on familial relationships, grief, but also growth during the process and not waiting to figure out your life once you're a ""perfect person"" with all one's baggage resolved ", ,

revisiting the book was nice, though because of time and me reading a lot of books since then, fading the memories of this book, most details were not new but more of a rediscovery? how all the pieces, hints, red herrings?, tease the plot in not only this book, but from what i remember of books 2-5 as well. 

overall very fun, some elements that does make it clear it is a ya fantasy novel but mostly not in a bad way. excited to continue my re-read of this series, as i have been trying to do since having more reading/story experience and reading them from an adult perspective. ", ,
45,not like other girls,meredith adamo,4.50,90.00%,448,"2,024",mystery,teen/ya,2024-06-23,2024-06-25,3.0,"i first came across this book on my goodreads feed, and requested the library ebook on a whim. i enjoyed it and loved it so much, the premise sucked me in, which reminded me how much i enjoy mystery stories and should read more of them. 

my brain is still reeling from the ending, how much the story unraveled and twisted that i was sucked in reading the last 1/3 of the book rushing to figure out what is happening. the pacing of the story was good, how things were revealed, the red herrings or even the mc just misunderstanding certain details leading us down a rabbit hole, i felt all was delivered well. no parts of the story felt dragged or filler, maybe at the end it would seem fast? but given the nature of the mystery being solved, the speed added to the rushed nature the characters felt as they were trying to figure out why maddie went missing.

the characters.. man let's just say that everyone sucks and move on haha 
but actually, the more we found out about maddie, jo, and the others, the more messed up they were, how the privileged yet very broken family lives. also just being dumb stupid naïve kids. and the human nature of being so selfish and the desperation to the point of becoming morally grey, how some characters saw their relationships for more than what they are, whether it be romanticized or transactional view of it. a very realistic understanding of high school drama, as the author addressed topics and themes beyond the typical soapy teen drama, and having these aspects not just to have them to make it a teen drama mystery but to have meaning and the characters experiences be cathartic. (if this at all makes any coherent sense aha)

i also appreciated the aspect of delving more into jo and the life leading up until maddie went missing. how in trying to figure out the reason maddie needed her help right before she went missing, jo was confronted to look at her past actions and experiences, how those affected her to the point of not even realizing the effects until years later. i felt so angry for jo about the revenge porn, but also sad how she kept justifying in her mind that all those actions done against her was her fault, her mistake for doing a, b, c, or not saying x, y, z. (EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T !!) the delivery of these heavy topics felt it was done right, going through how girls feel and the steps of grief through those traumatic experiences. how much women yearn for friendship and love that we don't receive and how much the world screws us over. (i'm not sure where i'm going with this) but i appreciate that we not only got to see jo through the realization but also the recovery and growth from it, how she started to develop female friendships again, talking through those traumatic experiences to others. 

my brain fully hasn't processed this book to write more about it but nonetheless i really enjoyed this. i always love a mystery and trying to solve it and i should intentionally read more in the genre....", ,
46,crown of midnight,sarah j. maas,4.50,90.00%,420,"2,013",fantasy,teen/ya,2024-06-26,2024-06-28,3.0,"it's been so many books and a significant amount of time since i've read this book that i forgot most of the plot. the only part i remembered was the big twist and the events leading up to it, which when i got to the part knew instantly yet still crushed me like the first time. the bigger twist towards the end that enhances the twist i did forget though, and maybe because i was drawn into the book taking away my attention, i did not pick up on the clues like i did for how the antagonist was brought up in the first book.

this book felt like such an upgrade from the first, other than the love triangle that goes on, not much did feel like a ya novel. yes the characters are in that age range 18-20's, but because of the whole issue of solving the puzzle(s) with the king and the darkness lurking in the castle, maybe distracted me? or made the plot more interesting that my brain didn't register the love triangle elements too much. 

speaking of the love triangle, classic 2010's ya novel trope. it's not the worst depiction but also not the best, just alright and decently in there and it makes sense (sorta). i do like that we eventually step away from the love triangle and a decision (not to be specified to avoid spoilers aha) is made (sort of). i really enjoyed the relationship development with celeana and ""the others"" (chaol, dorian, nehemia) that they all get to know each other and find out more things even to their dismay. but also the lies and hidden truths that celeana goes about telling as she tries to manuver around being the newly appointed king's champion but also solving elena's riddle? hint about darkness in the castle.

overall very fun intense book. heartbreak only makes you stronger, right? celeana? oof. aha. excited to continue rereading the series, to get into more politics as this book only starts to get into it. though unfortunately i cannot access my irl copies of the rest of the series so will have to take a break until i do </3 unless my library ebooks come through lol", ,

chicken. film. youth.
probably will be a similar sentiment for all the stories but relatable story environment with the characters and circumstances. the main story seems like it was occurring within the chicken shop man telling the story? though intriguing a bit confused, like the delivery and presentation was unique but the message (at least how I interpret it) felt a beat off with this unique presentation

zeros:ones
interesting concept. not sure how the story was going and then it just ended. related to luna? i think is her name, but how she felt during the transition period in her life as she’s in a fellowship post graduation feeling lost and empty as she reflects on her relationships past and present
3.5 stars

wing and the radio
i think how the story started and how it was leading with the two perspectives i liked, but then it drifted it off only connecting in the end. and even how it connected i can accept but idk i wanted a bit more? thematically enjoyed, the feelings of being lost, similar to the previous story, even other ones too, about reflection and mixture of regret, melancholy, wistfulness, i did enjoy. a sad tone with no expected concrete ending but more like a glimpse into both of these character lives with maybe a changing point in their lives. 
3.25 stars

the girl with double eyelids
i think i liked this one the most, maybe because it was the longest story in the book, so it felt more fleshed out and could learn more the characters. the theme was eerie but realistic, and even though there was no clear explanation or resolution, xiao yun seeing the invisible tattoos as omens about the person made the story interesting.
4 stars

the virtuoso
reading about a girl aiming to be the best at piano in her state reminded me of my years playing and practicing. interesting thoughts and themes about striving to be the best, that even feeling like you were perfect, that perfection was not there, the feeling of falling short that someone’s better.

but man, it's like seeing an old friend, being in the shadowhunters universe, much less with my favorite of the two main groups? with the london crowd, all now grown and reading about their kids in their late teen formative years. most of the characters felt unique, but also strongly resembling characteristics of the original london group, making sense since they are the children other than cordelia, of henry, will, jem, tessa, gideon, gabriel, cecily, charlotte, sophie, etc etc. also it was fun to see appearances of magnus bane and ragnor fell, and an ominous visit with the mention of malcolm fade (if you read dark artifices... well yeah) each of the main group felt unique and recognizable, though due to the larger group of the 6 + alstair and grace lol i always had to take a second to remember the parentage of christopher and thomas. 

there were definitely references of couple of the short stories from shadowhunters academy that i sorta remember vaguely but not enough to recall the details about the tension between alstair and the merry thieves. i could see for many people, sorta including myself that the amount of characters introduced can be overwhelming, with the carstairs, herondales, lightwoods, and fairchilds, in all their messy complicated glory. 

the plot was a slow burn for sure, as mentioned. it does make sense given it is the start to a trilogy and many of the key pieces are hidden from us or only starting to unravel at the end of this book which made me mad, to the point of the old days when i was younger reading books and chucking something in anger or frustration, knowing what was happening but the main characters be in the dark haha

i did again like i did with dark artifices, with wanting to remember details look up character bios on the wiki and spoil elements of the story with certain character details that would be revealed or hinted at, though i did stop myself from finding out more details and was still able to enjoy the story unfolding and learning how the story arrived to certain major plot points. 

seems interesting how things are set up, playing into the concept of the first shadowhunter/warlock  people with lucie and james. harkens back to clary and jace in the original series, though that was less obvious given that lucie and james have that warlock background and context. this trilogy being a direct sequel to the infernal devices is interesting and am curious how things from that first trilogy further connects to this one. 

note: man i want to strangle grace and matthew but for completely different reasons. oh also add james there too. the miscommunication is strong in this book with its relationship dynamics and though adds tension and more plot devices also makes me want to bang my head on the wall because it's so frustrating alkfjlwiefakw oh yes let's keep a secret about something that is very important but not share it to anyone and keep it to ourselves and it definitely won't go over badly by doing this.. -.-

this book really flew by for me, i think the plot was unraveling well (to my annoyance for wanting to know what was happening lol) and kept me gripped reading through, especially considering for me it's a decently hefty book at around 600+ pages. 

i enjoyed living through these characters, despite all the silly dumb annoyingly stupid things that they would do, how sometimes they were so blinded or trusting by someone else for the plot to twist into more catastrophe. especially at certain points, i did get annoyed by characters being too blinded, basically in their good nature and seeing the best in people that they would help someone to only continue to cause them pain by said person. like, james, lucie, really, we are doing this again? again the frustration that ""oh i can't tell them 'xyz' because they won't forgive me or i can't do that to them by letting them know"" and it made me want to strangle them a little or slam my head on the wall... lol :/

i am curious as to how this trilogy will wrap up and the plot lines will tie together. but overall i enjoyed it? this book but definitely some annoyances that the same character issues keep cropping up and not being resolved. like the miscommunication and secrets between the merry thieves + cordelia & lucie are just adding more and more secrets... sigh

also i hate being taunted by cordelia and james being an actual thing for it to only be ripped away by annoying little grace.. smh... lol", ,

it definitely took a moment to get into the story, with getting used to sanderson’s writing style and all the exposition. i also did struggle in the beginning with getting attached to the characters? or moreso it was hard to grasp rooting for the characters? yes i thought they were interesting and their motivations too but maybe because of each characters’ flaw very evident in the beginning of the story made it hard to do so idk especially considering the heist-like premise which would normally hook me into the story

that being said i felt that the characters were so strong and individual/distinct, having both good and bad qualities, which i did enjoy. 

i think what continued to draw me in was the whole plot/premise, curious how these characters were gonna pull off a rebellion or sorts against a sort of god. the whole magic(?) system with metals is really fascinating, especially with how they tap into both mental and physical abilities. i also appreciate the politics with all its complications and nuances, with not just the nobility but also the inquisitors, which were like another branch of government but were significantly more powerful given they had mistborn abilities? or even beyond such. 

it took effort to not try and finish the book last night just incase the ending was a cliffhanger and i would be awake until like 4 am reeling lol. so much to say that even though i struggled a bit in the beginning to get into it, whenever i took a chunk of time to read, the chapters flew by

overall i enjoyed delving into the world of mistborn and the whole magic system and politics and social classes. knowing that this trilogy extends into a greater sanderson universe i’m very curious to how things will unfold with vin and the rest of them :)

i was hopeful at the beginning of this book, as i enjoy mystery/crime stories but have to gotten to reading them that much. not to mention that i was charmed with molly, who i related to an extent about having a particular structure to things and having things clean. as i continued to read, molly had more characteristics that were similar to of a neurodivergent person. but i was disappointed when this was just passed off as a “quirk” and other characters saw her as robotic and odd. i was frustrated so much for her, that the author danced around this and never addresses it despite the whole backstory of being bullied when she was younger and taken advantage of by many people as the story progresses due to her lack of ability to recognize facial expressions (DESPITE this is a plot hole since that was something she has been working on since she has been growing up with gran and in the beginning of the story is able to recognize it? like huhh)

i also was under the assumption? or the premise lead me to believe that molly would be the one solving the mystery case when she didn’t, and unfortunately was dragged into things unknowingly, even though the author makes it evident for us the reader to realize that she’s swept up in helping juan manuel and rodney because of her good will and romantic interest respectively. honestly it was quite painful and frustrating to see it happen with her accepting or being blinded because of it. 

the ending wrapped up okay, though it did feel somewhat predictable and corny, but i also dislike that the final details of the crime was added almost like an afterthought in the end of the epilogue. not to mention that the reasoning of molly's actions from that epilogue make no sense going back from her as a person in her beliefs that were established at the beginning of the book. idk man this just irked me that such a major plot point is just stuffed at the very end of the epilogue with no sense of how the plot flowed with things already wrapping up. like it could've been delivered better, even if it was still at the end of the book.

this was very fun and reminded me that i should try to find more light-hearted urban fantasy? romance or otherwise books. or even just paranormal characters in the real world

had some frustrations with the whole miscommunication-type conflicts, or simply just the mistrust, which understandably so given the initial circumstances, but the fact that oz and mariel circled back to this mistrust and assuming the worse without hearing out too many times for my comfort got to be a bit frustrating. wish that the resolution? of the conflict as well as the revelations felt too rushed at the end, how things were spiraling then bam crux of the issue then bam resolved, then bam last chapter everything's all good. with how the author structured things, it made sense with how it progressed, and just tacking on more chapters wouldn't necessarily fix this mild peeve i have, nor do i have a clear solution to how i would hypothetically fix this rushing to the ending issue

on the other hand, i did love the growth arc that mariel went through, the frustrating aspects of her bearing through her mother's insults, struggling to find boundaries with her through confrontation as well as realizing her supporters, and taking strength from them to face her issues head on. the confidence that grew in her was lovely to read as the story progressed, and liked how one conflict that mariel stood up for, helped her set up for the next one, with a little more and more confidence to speak up with her feelings <3 wish we got a bit more in seeing oz's growth trajectory, but maybe because it was in conjunction with mariel's but it just felt like it happened and we're at the end with him in love and standing up for himself, even though the path to here was unclear at a good chunk of times.

overall was a fun book, felt a bit rushed with the ending and how things wrapped up a bit fast, and would've wanted more mmc on-page time with personal growth", ,

i struggled a bit to continue reading in the middle of the book, as the politics were increasing. ironic, given that usually i enjoy learning about government politics, and it’s not an issue in this book, but more personally i wasn’t hooked enough to fuel through it. but in hindsight i do appreciate those elements, especially as it builds in tension and plot but also how the characters, namely elend reveal their morals and values and opinions, and how they may change or develop by the end of the book. 

speaking of, i really loved the character development of the main crew, how they changed given the circumstances of the post-coup environment of scrambling to figure out how to manage the government system and kingdom-ship as well as adjusting and adapting from the rag-tag thieving group with a heist plot to nobility and leadership positions in a monarchy. i did like that vin and elend’s relationship was more in focus with this book, accounting for the imbalances in their relationship, mistborn and not, assassin and king. we got to witness their struggles grappling somewhat unknowingly through these imbalances all while dealing with neighboring kings wanting to seize power. 

ah yes, the introduction of the unknown mistborn, that we later find out is zane. not to get into heavy spoilers, but i am curious about some things that were not addressed that may be connected to what vin heard at the end of the the book. not to mention marsh, who was absent from most of the book, only to flit in and out occasionally, which had me having more questions about what’s going on with him, especially when it seems the inquisitors are still around? but not in luthadel? 

the plot was definitely a slow burn with how conflicts were building and for the most part did enjoy that aspect. yes, i did struggle during the slow parts, similar to empire of storms, but once i was in a groove reading, i powered through multiple chapters. it did help having the library ebook deadline being due in x amount of time so i had to read x amount of chapters a day to finish in time, creating almost like a marathon environment reading this. lol

overall i did very much enjoy this book with the war politics. i’m excited to read the finale of this mistborn trilogy which perfect timing, i just got the library ebook a couple days before finishing. but i do have other rentals i need to finish first before starting aha

later:

i liked the emotional complex elements to this story, with ian’s backstory having a terrible father that’s verbally and emotionally abusive. i wish that there was more with delilah’s part, whether it be on her and jack’s parents dying when they were young or something else 

i liked having jack in the story as a character, connecting the two mc’s but also felt like he was just there? at most for comic relief and to play the brother in the brother’s best friend trope so it felt like he needed more to him as a character

overall was fun read with some emotional aspects and maybe would’ve liked either more baking or more hockey in the story but it felt like we only got a little of both", ,
56,the fake mate,lana ferguson,3.75,75.00%,372,"2,023",romance,workplace,2024-08-23,2024-08-25,3.0,"the whole premise was intriguing to me, especially as i’ve been wanting to read some paranormal romance lately and this was a little silly, light but fun to read before i go into more heavier? ish content with sally rooney and finishing the last book in the mistborn original trilogy lol

the whole omegaverse was not a surprise or new to me, maybe because in high school i read a lot of fanfiction of varying genres and universes so the omegaverse trope was familiar from the details i remember. thus said details were not offputting or surprising to read, (i.e. growling, turning into a wolf, sex-related elements specific to omegaverse) i think the author, given the circumstances handled these elements well. i was a bit concerned but that was quickly diffused during the scene where noah and mackenzie turned into wolves and reached a point where description could go on for so long before dialogue would get… interesting… with them being in wolf form. 

i think the book does what it’s meant to do, and it had enough of the fake dating (or mated in this case) that i was satisfied with my hopes of it going into this book. i do maybe wish to elevate this book more, if we got to explore mackenzie’s orphan-ness and childhood trauma, to better explain her as a character and why she’s so headstrong and independent despite the stigmas of a female omega. likewise with noah, would have liked it more if we got to explore more about noah’s standoffish nature and why he feels the need to close himself off from people until mackenzie, and have little friendships and relationships due to it. yes it would change the book tone-wise but maybe because i enjoy romance books more when they go beyond the simple romance relationship, with emotional complexities and such. but c’est la vie

despite all that i did enjoy noah and mackenzie as characters, both individually and together, their goofy, snarky natures but also the tender and sweet relationship that developed over the course of the book. i found myself chuckling and laughing outloud while reading at certain points and surprisingly! did not cringe that much on the puns and dad jokes in this book despite my general dislike and cringing of such humor. 

i probably would’ve finished this in one day but it got stretched to three as i was busy during the day and only read right before bed, to the point of falling asleep, phone in hand lmao

overall it was a fun read and a little too much sex imo but given it’s an omegaverse book the amount of sex scenes tracks. i still love fake dating as a trope and will continue to consume books that have it. ", ,

i also really enjoyed the format of the novel, even though it was an attribute of contention later in the story, i liked that before we switch into a different perspective of the book, between alice and eileen, we get a email letter one sending to the other, giving almost a glimpse of their headspace before going into the narrative chapter

i did have to shift my mind a bit in terms of how i saw the two main ""couples,"" eileen and simon and then alice and felix, as prior to this i have been reading a couple romance novels. i was intrigued about these two pairings, though more specifically on eileen and simon, maybe because personality wise is closer in more aspects to me compared to alice and felix. but my goodness, i was about to get frustrated at these characters, stuck in their own heads, unable to communicate, or even unable to form what their feelings for each other actually are. 

but, during the reframing, i saw the beauty in the broken, how it felt very human, realistic to witness these character grappling with such heaviness and confusion. and i related to this kind of confusion, grappling, stumbling through life, specifically in such the beginning of adulthood, trying to figure things out but things are not going in the same way as you would imagine in your head... learning to live not just as an individual, which is hard in itself but also adding other people into the equation, romantic or platonic relationships. 

plot wise, looking back it's not very simple but it's not overtly complex, felt like a nice balance, especially that it was moreso a character driven story. normally the whole story wrapping up in the last couple chapters would bother me, but pacing wise it felt okay? so not a bother in that sense. 

in such, the morally grey, confusing, frustrating characters, i enjoyed this read as they tried to navigate their lives, mainly with each other. ", ,

overall i think the main things i liked and disliked in this book is basically the same as the precursor to this book. characters are interesting with interesting complex backgrounds, navigating emotional journeys as well as real ones with familial and community dynamics. i really disliked, more specifically in this one, how the conflict climax, twist, and resolution essentially happened in the last 2 chapters, mind you this book has 33 chapters total. not to spoil anything but it really just gets dropped at the end and things felt very hastily put together. the author made some great characters and even plot/conflict things, but ""landing the plane"" so to speak, felt kinda like an emergency landing. things made it in the end, but execution was shaky.

i have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head but also no words coming out erm so this review might be all over the place

re-reading this book reminded me why i loved, and have it in my favorite book collection. the pacing and plot development felt solid, how we get tidbits peeled back, and the threeish main perspectives going back and forth, revealing pieces of the war to come that we get not fully in context, to only be realized later as things start to tie together. if i remember correctly, this is the first, in the series that really focuses on these shifting perspectives, telling whole stories with each of the sorta main three characters (dorian and chaol sorta share, though for most of the book it's in chaol's pov at the rifthold parts). i remembered things as i progressed in the story, so plot points weren't that surprisng to me, though how they happen i didn't remember how the certain plot point unfolded so the overall story-reading experience was not ruined from me remember certain things

i always enjoy character driven plots, even though this is a fantasy novel, which i feel tend to lean more on the plot and political aspects of the book rather than character development as the main focus. we get to see celeana's training arc as fae and the grief she starts to process and accept, not only the events of book 2 but also her past, with her family and during her time as an assassin for hire. 

this book we also get to meet manon, a character that i remember loving to read about, her as the sorta grey-area character given her position in this book in this war forming with the king of adarlan. though we see towards the end of this book, her forming her own thoughts and opinions in the matter foreshadowing the next books with her arc, i was still happy to read about her and her journey with abraxos.

probably like with many people, i would get a little disappointed whenever the chapter would end and we switch to the rifthold pov with chaol, dorian, and aedion. while interesting in some aspects, and despite it seeming like it would get into more politics of things being in the capital with the king, it really felt surface level and like typical ya kids, teens or people in their early 20's trying to do rebellion things but with not much information being told (that we may already know from the other perspectives) so it just feels... meh. lol 

overall i really do enjoy it, while reading it time would just fly by and get through a whole chunk. 

i started reading this after taking a break after finishing crown of midnight, only because my library ebook of queen of shadows arrived so i don't have to painstakingly wait for the next book after the cliffhanger that i thought i would get from finishing this book lol", ,

also just in time with 1.5 hours to spare with my library rental, finishing the about last half of the book in the past two days... 

but what a whirlwind 

i always remembered that the plot and character arcs in 4 and 5 of this series felt so strong and intense. and it was as good as i remembered. though i would say that in terms of layers, it's pretty solid against a more ""typical"" fantasy book, i can say now after reading brandon sanderson xdd but truly after all these years, i really do feel like it still holds well. the layers of plot, and the twists! how each layer gets peeled back and then another wrench gets thrown into the mix and adds a new dynamic not just plotwise with aelin retaking her homeland but also the different characters all spread out both sides wise and location. from how i remember the last time i read this book, i didn't really remember much of the plot. tidbits here and there, like something about lysandra, to the key moment at the end, and some of the bigger lore bombs still felt monumental due to my brain forgetting what happened aha

i don't even know what to say anymore, erm. but very fun, nervous because i do remember the cliffhanger from the next book, but excited to read the journey of aelin and her court :^)

so first, more on the plot. it really felt like we weren’t even in the car to go anywhere. i really felt that directionless feeling as i was reading, making it hard to stay focused on the story. the closest connection i could make it that this more meandering storytelling was reflective of henry’s (and sorta halle’s) internal battles, which i guess?? the closest other thing i can think of was the premise being plot-ish with henry needing to pass thorton’s class and halle needing experiences for her book, but that olotline wrapped up midway through the book… so yeah. i need some semblance of a plot in a book even with a romance book. 

i think on top of that, we get teased with friends group dynamics despite the fact that one of halle’s biggest regret? fear? is that she has no friends. that’s wasn’t a big of a thing in the book as i thought it would be, as halle and henry mostly spend time just by themselves and the respective friend groups show up only here and there. as someone who really enjoys friend dynamics in books, this was a disappointing aspect, especially when it was a bigger element in the other books (icebreakers & wildfire). 

overall it was fun but it fell more flat in some aspects. but yet, i enjoyed the more serious/mature topics of adhd and eldest daughter syndrome for henry and halle respectively.

but i really enjoyed this one. yes the miscommunication is strong but i felt like it made sense with the conflict of the main story, as the mc and ml had strong insecurities and anxieties with abandonment (though ml was slightly different with financial security related). probably because this was the main conflict, georgia's constant fear of her friends leaving her or drifting apart, is/was a very real fear or insecurity that i had/sorta still have. 

also i love friend group dynamics and wedding planning trope so this was a blast, even if there was rom-com level chaos happening with fires, cancelations, and rain lol. i can see why it would get annoying for others when reading it, but weirdly was fun? and like wanting to see how georgia and eli navigate through the chaos to salvage adam and grace's wedding.

maybe in the future i should read them more closely back to back, as the details of the first volume is sort of hazy as it's been three years since i finished the first one, and nearly two years since i've started this volume.

not much to say other than it was really emotional reading this, but also at the same time engaging my theological side of understanding and studying. how henri (and how i also felt) went through each of the main characters in the prodigal son parable, breaking down who they are and what they represent, and how much he resonated with each one, at different points of his faith walk. how one can be lost, realizing the need to come home in tears, asking for forgiveness, like the younger brother. as well as the older brother, feeling bitter and resentful of others receiving love, feeling like the ""diligent one"" not receiving any praise or reward, compared to the reckless, immature younger brother. and finally the father, having both maternal and paternal visions of love for the children, acceptance with open arms no matter the circumstance. the beauty in the full circle narrative, was a pleasure to read about.

i think this book really tops the series, with queen of shadows being a very very close second. i loved how we get combined elements of adventuring across the continents and politicking (not really but sorta) in various environments and all the team ups and character appearances from nearly every character that had a significant presence from the four previous books. and that is something that i really really love in stories, a large-scale avengers endgame-like team up to try and defeat the big bad. and also just large group dynamics, especially knowing the backstories or secretive elements of each character. 

probably because of the adventuring and teaming up i flew through this book fast. and knowing that i have to pause reading the series to read a romance novel that i have library rented and THEN when i can go back in i don't even get the satisfaction of reading more about the main gang and are kinda forced into this sidequest with chaol and nesryn.... sigh. it's fine but it feels like a stretch of time. (not to mention that probably during this time i'll be getting a lot of library books that will be free to rent that i've been waiting months on the waitlist... so it'll delay continuing even more... PAIN)

i really felt like the characters were all so strong, the main cast and their own strengths and weaknesses. how many secrets and layers of things only portions of the cast know about and other don't. shifting back and forth with pov's was so intense and there were definitely points where i was left on cliffhangers for one pov to jump to a completely different one, on the different part of the continent.. some minor agony.. 

and even thinking about how much aelin held in, not necessarily because she didn't trust her court, but rather that she was so afraid of letting them down if her grand scheme didn't work. the burden that she placed on herself, for plans upon plans, contingencies and such.. damn

i did also notice, not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but how sjm sorta starts shuffling couples together, pretty heavily in this book. this being for the main cast, basically everyone except gavriel and fenrys. and that's probably a common thing? that sjm does since i remember that in the acotar series the main cast/group also follow a similar pattern of everyone being paired off, and (probably) will ride off into the sunset together.. probably.

overall i really loved this for the strong intense distinct characters and cast/group dynamics with chaos and hyjinks that ensued. along with the pieces of the puzzle in terms of overall plot, falling into place. very satisfying even if it did break my heart </3 and yeah my head hurts now from all that crying that i did during the last 6 or so chapters of reading.. LOL

last note: minor spoiler; glad i read assassin's blade in the series right after queen of shadows.. refreshed on certain characters and glad we got to see them as they appear :)

but despite all, it did take a few chapters to get hooked, i think it was around the point where for the first time, clementine finds that she can't go back in time when she wants to. it hooked me instantly and i sped read it all today after that point ahaha

i was charmed by both iwan and clementine, how they were struggling in life, both past and present, and reflecting to try and change things. their chemistry from the start was solid and drew me in as they continued to interact with each other. i love how their lives were becoming intertwined, even if they have never met, yet other people, or even themselves might have passed each other before. the beauty of time travel related stories. <3

the plot was good, nothing overtly complicated, just enough complication with the whole time traveling and mid-life crisis aspects. pacing felt smooth, other than the rocky parts in the beginning, but looking back, made sense given the context of grief, how the plotline would feel rocky and dark as clementine is just recently coping with the loss of her close aunt, especially now living in her apartment.

overall i really really loved it and it was fun yet emotional from the life contemplation to different aspects of clementine trying to have timelines line up just to get the right timing with iwan..

but really, this book was fun, but also agonizing? i felt like the plot and main conflict of the story of bridget (allegedly) running away from her wedding, would drag so much and had the feeling where the author kept putting it off in a way? which was annoying and i kept putting down the book in periods because i felt that way too many times while reading the book. not to mention that the ending/conclusion just kept going?? like wdym i'm only wrapping up part 2 and there's a whole part 3 even though a good chunk of the conflict was resolved?? the splitting of the two things, do make sense and i'm not sure how i would rework the plot of the book to make it better? but i didn't like the whole plot development and pacing, as it felt a bit messy.

but despite so, i do really like small town story settings and this was very fun. the characters felt very real and developed, with their intricacies and relationships fleshed out. i also liked that we first get to sit with the core of the characters, with lucy, bridget, and felix, before we open up with each of their worlds a little more and more with their own problems and relationships. 

i love lucy and felix's relationship, especially with the flashback chapters. seeing how their relationship developed and fractured over the years with the layers of miscommunication and secrets. despite my annoyances with the plot pacing and development, (slight spoiler but will be vague) i do like that they did take a pause on things and sort themselves out before reconsidering. 

overall, i think the book was fun but my annoyances with how the plot was laid out is too big of a factor and have to dock some points..", ,
71,the mysterious affair at styles,agatha christie,3.75,75.00%,174,"1,920",mystery,adult,2024-11-12,2024-11-16,5.0,"started reading on a whim as i've always wanted to read agatha christie but never did until now, and these novels are fairly short, which would help me in my futile attempt to read and catch up to 90-100 books this year..

the story was a bit slow in the beginning, as i was trying to get used to the pacing and writing style. i did hear that this book was kickstarted by a bet and was a weekly serial initially which is cool. 

don't want to get into the details, but once the investigation started was when i started to be captivated by poirot and his maddening method of investigating. i did have a few guesses as to who did it, but would second guess myself, like hastings on who did, after more evidence and information was collected haha. 

looking forward to reading more of poirot :)", ,

and i am annoyed at my teenaged self for donating my old copy of this book and have to eventually get one for my collection </3

beloved charlotte, how she is witty and clever. goofy wilbur, and the rest of the barn cast and their zaniest yet support of wilbur. these characters are so lively to me, and fun to read about.

but i will definitely read this again in the future and yes i still will tear up at those ending chapter every time :’) ", ,

reading this as i’m older, i enjoy the “excessive” allusions. i like how they play into the story even if they don’t necessarily make sense plot narrative wise . it does add a lot of whimsy for sure. the chapter in the dark island felt very poignant to me personally, that there is light to guide us though the darkness

the plot is different from previous books as they go on adventures through the lone islands to find these lost lords from the calormen days(?). despite the different issues that happen around every island, it did feel more easy going than a war like in lion the witch and the wardrobe or prince caspian. not that it’s bad, but a big difference in pacing and flow of the story

overall it was fun and certain scenes became vivid because i remembered them directly from the movie i watched over 10 years ago lmaoo", ,
74,the fiancé dilemma,elena armas,4.00,80.00%,432,"2,024",romance,small-town,2024-11-20,2024-11-25,6.0,"this really was a whole lot better than the long game,, lmao. not sure if it's because of the premise? so that drew me in more and kept me entertained? though like with the long game, there were still definitely points where i was just reading to move on and find out what happens

i think overall the plot was okay. it delivered what was promised, and didn't bother me that much? definitely a character driven plot, and a very simple one, leading off the pretend marriage trope. there were points in the story where i felt like it was holding out on details, just for the sake of dragging out the plot. like at some point, i was like, we get it, josie has abandonment issues and really goes for that flight, in fight or flight scenarios and doesn't address or open up about her problems, to literally anyone.. until matthew starts forces it out of her. like c'mon man this is the 4th5th time of this song and dance, this issue keeps cropping up and getting shoved into a box that is visibly overflowing..

but speaking of characters, i really did love matthew a lot. a mix of both sides, the sweet and goofy yet serious and firm. blond hair and glasses?? kind, loveable dork type ML? fantastic. but also now looking back on it, almost too perfect? like for a story with the mc having commitment fears because of abandonment issues, the guy really doesn't have a whole lot of his own that he needs to work through? though i guess josie's the one with greater problems and he has only minor problems of lying about his past ties in the grand scheme of things... so i guess he was a good ML to have in contrast with the falling apart MC. lol 

idk man i liked reading it in the moment but after reflecting back and getting into some details of what actually happened and breaking them down.. idk if i'm completely sold lmao. but i would say i would place this book second, with spanish love deception being first, for elena armas' books. definitely a lot better, reading experience wise, though maybe the commonality was they were both fake-dating?? interesting...", ,
75,not another love story,julie soto,4.25,85.00%,384,"2,024",romance,adult,2024-11-25,2024-11-26,2.0,"ngl it all makes sense but i didn't realize it until i read the acknowledgements that this was a repurposed fanfic lmaoo and OFC it's reylo

but despite that i really liked this book? i flew through, and yes looking back there are some issues aha which i had to dock some partial stars for. but it did make me very nostalgic for my orchestra days in high school, especially with the auditioning and first chair moments. and to top it off it takes place in new york? more fun

on to more of the slight issues i have looking back, first i feel like the transition from enemies to lovers was very sudden and did feel a tad insta-lovey, especially that it happened sooner in the book than i expected. almost like i wanted the tension between alex and gwen to grow a bit more, to breathe before moving onto the romance.. but maybe that's just me.

i can see why it would be an issue to others, how alex was starting to slip into the more manipulative? controlling parts that we see in the obvious antagonists of calvin and nathan, especially in how he interacts with gwen, despite maybe having her best interests, but ultimately not letting her choose for herself. i did like that their relationship was veering into a younger parallel of nathan and ava, to explain the hidden complexities of alex's relationships and tumultuous past. but my goodness, the antics of both calvin and nathan irritated me so much, how blatant they were throughout the book, yet our mc and ml were kinda blinded? from it or just so easy to accept it and turn a blind eye GAH.

as mentioned, i enjoyed the orchestra elements, how they played into the character conflicts, both internal ones and relationship ones. the crux of the conflicts being such a common yet resonating? theme of finding oneself and being stuck between security and passion, as well as identity vs familial/group comfort. 

the spice scene were a tad too much for me personally aha but i do like the metaphorical element of passion of music bleeding into intense emotions, or even being one of the same, especially when playing with each other, having so much tension already

also i do like how it ended, but how things wrapped up felt so fast and neat? when for having such complications in multiple relationships in the book, it was resolved so quickly and often not fully on the page but offscreen :/ maybe it is because of it being within the romance genre adds to this almost rush to join them back together, but it does always slightly bother me when the ending doesnt have a smooth landing compared to how the pacing and plot flow of the rest of the book went. 

overall, i think it was a fun read and i enjoyed it, as i read it within 24 hours haha but there were definitely some faults, mainly minor ones with the plot development", ,
76,a werewolf's guide to seducing a vampire,sarah hawley,3.75,75.00%,444,"2,024",romance,paranormal,2024-11-26,2024-12-01,6.0,"i definitely liked this book more than the previous one in this sorta series, though i think the first book places slightly higher than this one in a series ranking.

overall, very fun and like the whole debacle of a timid man with a powerful woman, but the curse places them in a traditional relationship stance? structure? and the awkwardness and conflict that ensues because of the curse, along with their own struggles that they were going through in this book. plot wise, it was fun and engaging, very character driven as do many romance novels go, other than the accidentally drunken purchase of a plastic crystal holding a curse/blessing subplot. 

the romance makes sense in hindsight with these character dyanmics, both in the different personalities and cultural backgrounds but also the curse too. but i wasn't the most crazy about it, especially with the whole half vampire/succubus thing. like that was a roundabout way to basically explain why eleanora was human and presumably could live the rest of her life growing old with ben. and the sex drive, bc hey! it's a spicy romance book! idk felt a bit gimicky and for the trope just being thrown in there. idk. but then again, i prefer intimate scenes to have a purpose in character and relationship plot/arcs not just to have it bc it's a book in the adult romance genre so they have to have sex....so yeah

oH right the campaign thing. in theory was cool but i got kinda bored and annoyed, maybe because ben was getting a bit steamrolled (unintentionally) with things on his plate, so midway through the book just started skipping a lot of those scenes... but it was fun seeing the scooby gang with their cameos, and their distance and their distanced? appearances make sense as ben is more in his shell on top of helping eleanora get used to modern day society and knowledge. but the gradual integration was nice and i always love and appreciate friend group dynamics. 

overall this was mostly fun to read, some things that i didn't care for personally, but i do enjoy a more relaxed paranormal setting for a book here and there. if sarah hawley writes another book in this series i would eventually get to reading it, just bc they're easy chill reads but not like a immediate library request i guess haha

also sidenote, ben working with plants through the book made the itch of buying another house plant even though i have so many, kept happening lolll", ,

but this was very very cute and the email correspondence in the majority of the book was fun though i was reading too fast that i got lost keeping track of who was saying what (skill-issue xd) and how the two characters joined up was endearing yet chaotic and once they finally met i was yearning for more story but it wrapped up pretty much there, every point in time being roughly around valentine's day. man that reminds me i should read one day, since i do really like this method of storytelling", ,
78,worst wingman ever,abby jimenez,4.25,85.00%,61,"2,924",romance,holiday,2024-12-08,2024-12-08,1.0,"this one was a cute, yet melancholy one. i did still like it even if it was undercut with not only the fmc being a hospice nurse, but she was also taking care of her dying grandmother. it reminded me of when i was younger, visiting my grandmother in hospice 🙂 it did add that level of realism, how things in life can change at difficult times as well. 

but yeah this story was cute, a good mix of sad and happy moments. and like with the first story, i enjoyed the letter exchanging", ,
79,the murder on the links,agatha christie,4.00,80.00%,199,"1,923",mystery,adult,2024-12-08,2024-12-08,1.0,"thanks to audiobooks and my penchant for being nauseous with transportation, i knocked out this one fast while traveling. 

one review made me laugh because they summarized my feelings about hastings this book: quite annoying. yammering on about a woman (of questionable age) many times of different women, that she’s the love of his life. yeck. just ick. poirot making fun of hasting’ flightly attitude was amusing and cut through my annoyance. 

like with the murder at the styles, i did enjoy the layers of the mystery as well as the classic red-herrings and misdirections. 

overall very fun and the pacing/reading speed helped with listening to the dramatized audiobook", ,

but i've been enjoying these short story collections even if they are kinda mid lol", ,
81,hero of ages,brandon sanderson,4.75,95.00%,572,"2,008",fantasy,adult,2024-08-31,2024-12-16,108.0,"i have finished!! after a slightly embarrassing (just bc i procrastinated reading when i had access every time xd) three rounds of library holds and marathoning the majority of the book in the last week of the last round of the library holds.. i feel like crying but only small tears to come out

yeah i really get it now, brandon sanderson's work, insane. lol this being the start of the cosmere universe?? i'm excited to continue.

truly, i love love the plot development, especially in this book, how all the pieces fall into place, reaching back to even all the way to the first book, connecting and expanding upon such simple ""truths"" we learned, growing bigger and bigger into the vast world of the final empire. a lovely mix of politics, and fantasy magical power elements. with a nice tossing of various relationships, from romantic, platonic, to even acquaintances and adversaries and associates. how they all blended together jumping through different perspectives to convey such an intense plotline. the pacing was solid and every reveal felt just right, shocking and excitement for how it will continue in the story.

the character arcs, insane. looking back with book 1 & 2, truly get to see significant changes in our main girl vin, but also the rest of the cast. i love vin and elend :^) so much. how the two of them grappled with becoming emperors and dealing with not only politics and war but also fighting against an omnipresent god??? their wits, smarts, and cleverness. (and they end happy and contented! this is sorta a spoiler but i'm keeping it vague aha) how much they learn during their journey in this book, both separately and together, as well as working together as a couple. i love the main relationship messaging was about trust, such great trust for each other, it was almost like a level of communication with no words needed. that they knew the best of each other and trusted that the end goal would work out. 
as well and sazed, even as in this book he undergoes a life crisis, mixed in with depression from the events of the end of book 2. i admire and relate to his love of knowledge and research, how he navigated through his struggles to reach the final truth, the realization and acceptance (of different instances though not stating for major spoilers ehe). 
much surprise that spook was a bigger player in this book, coming out of his shell per say, was wary about his sections but grew to sorta enjoy his part of the greater story maybe bc as his pov continued there was more connection with the overall plot. 
oH and i almost forgot about tensoon's pov/arc. loved it, and loved learning more about the kandra as he essentially gives himself up thinking he's doing the right thing since he technically betrayed his people, even if it was for the greater purpose..and it makes sense as a sub-antagonist but i got so annoyed at kanpaar lol
though ofc vin's was the top holding interest

with how much i seem to take my time reading brandon sanderson i am slightly nervous about the next books, even seeing the way of kings being 1k? pages? i think the longest book i've ever read is 800? so that's pretty intimidating to say the least aha but yeah. glad to finish this trilogy this year as it's been something i've been meaning to read for years, nearly a decade i would guess.", ,

overall rating 4 stars
avg rating: 3.95 stars
---

individual reviews:

the adventure of the western star
hastings tries his best to figure out the mystery, with him beaming at poirot for his success, only to be bested by poirot, as he jumped ahead too quickly. classic.
4.25 stars

the tragedy at marsdon manor
shorter but still interesting. i think i just about grasped the story, simple yet still some misdirection happening. 
4 stars

the adventure of the cheap flat
was interesting but not as good as the previous one, maybe because i just about grasped all the characters and pieces.
3.75 stars

the mystery of hunter's lodge
same as the previous, was interesting but wished it was a bit longer, fleshing out the story instead of jumping to the conclusion. the whole twisted family involved was interesting though.
3.75 stars

the million dollar bond robbery
clever of how the criminals got away with stealing the bonds, though with poirot on the case, nothing to be hidden forever! lol but yeah i felt like again, things were just told and hurried along
3.75 stars

the adventure of the egyptian tomb
i liked this one, maybe because it involved mythology and poirot being sneaky with how he presents himself to others, especially those in the case. using logic in what would be perceived as an illogical situation of a egyptian curse
4 stars

the jewel robbery at the grand metropolitan
this one was fun, maybe because it had some slight misdirection and multiple suspects.
4 stars

the kidnapped prime minister
very interesting, clever way of how the criminals went about it, but yet poirot strikes again. was fun to read
4.25 stars

the disappearance of mr. davenheim
was interesting, having poirot solve the mystery without ever interacting with the people involved. though reading not as fun as the other stories because of it lol
3.75 stars

the adventure of the italian nobleman
i kept having to reread, being lost of the plot, maybe because i was multitasking lol
3.75 stars

the case of the missing will
was fun and different, this time finding a will by a clever old uncle
4 stars

the veiled lady
was interesting, fun to read. the method of the mystery was clever.
4.25 stars

the lost mine
not as interesting maybe because involving chinese? leaves a weird taste remaining
3.75 stars

the chocolate box
melancholy but still interesting and fun to read

83,the murder of roger ackroyd,agatha christie,4.25,85.00%,288,"1,926",mystery,adult,2024-12-16,2024-12-20,5.0,"as i've been reading through the hercule poirot series, i've heard so much about this one, though with the recent adaptations of orient express and on the nile, i have heard of those before reading the series. i was hesitant, as this book was high on many lists of books to read.. and without giving much away i'd agree with those sentiments. though nowadays the plot narrative is more common but for its time it was definitely unique and surprising as a murder mystery

i really enjoyed it, reading from the perspective of dr. shepherd, a departure from captain hastings in the previous books. a nice break from his perspective, especially when i was growing to get annoyed by his odd commentary. poirot as usual is a standout in the series, from how he talks, his thought processes and how he uncovered the mystery after many many interviews and interactions with the entire cast of people of king's abbot

i'm curious to eventually read this in the future, to see if i could then pick up on the hints and red herrings that agatha christie laid out, as it took me until the second to last? chapter of the book as poirot was detailing all the information again. for being a person that can predict storylines from consuming so many stories, something so simple as a ""cozy"" agatha christie murder mystery threw me off haha", ,

i think that it was interesting reading a murder mystery about a chinese family, as it's not often a scenario, at least for me, that i'm used to or have read much of. though the mystery was over pretty quick and wish it had a bit more depth to it. wasn't crazy about the main character, josephine to have an accent but once it was cleared that she was in her 60's? or something it could make more sense but not that major in the grand scheme of things. just had that tinge of cliche feeling, with the overall story.

it was alright, a nice quick read to help boost my book count for this year lol", ,

i liked the two characters and their interactions, but transitioning from those brief interactions to the christmas party with their more, should I say intense? moments felt a tad rushed to me. theo felt a little too mr perfect like he was a romance caricature imo as we got more details about him, though the christmas decorations were sweet.

87,the big four,agatha christie,4.25,85.00%,272,"1,928",mystery,adult,2024-12-22,2024-12-26,5.0,"yes this was essentially a collection of short stories of a chaotic story that has some plot holes and not fully developed. but yet it was so much fun to read with the whole chaos and not the typical hercule poirot mystery novel

slight annoyances but they were common of the time, as an asian person how they refer to the chinese people in this story was unsavory and uncomfortable to read, to say the least. 

i did like the aspect of this mystery of catching the big four over the course of many many months with its kidnappings, cyphers, and disguises of many other of the trope aspects, yet amusing to have nonetheless. reading about poirot and hastings try and fail many times to outwit and outmaneuver the big four, a nearly supervillain feel to them as the story progressed

88,merriment and mayhem,alexandria bellefleur,3.50,70.00%,58,"2,024",romance,holiday,2024-12-26,2024-12-26,1.0,"fun and interesting at first, chaotic accident prone (at least at the current moment as the mc alleges) and firefighter romance. it kinda wrapped up very fast for me, maybe because i feel like spice/sex moments, unless for a certain type of style of story, needs to be built up with the couple's relationship outside the tension. idk maybe it's the picky part of me wanting that build up and for it to make sense and not just have it just to have it, which is my preference. 

it was fun but alright ", ,

thanks to the audiobook was able to zoom through this one, as i'm coughing in bed. aha
the whole build up was good, setting the pieces as we first meet ruth kettering and her millionaire father, to the cheating husband in-law and his intense french mistress, as well as the rest of the cast, when we start to board the train. this group of characters was fun to read about, as we get red herrings and misdirections or hints from character interactions that happened prior to the death of ruthie was fun to entangle. and as of course i didn't figure it out, though loosely did guess part of it right, just didn't realize who were the actual people involved haha", ,

97,the most wonderful crime of the year,ally carter,4.50,90.00%,295,"2,024",romance,mystery,2024-12-22,2024-12-31,10.0,"this was quite the perfect (""full"") book to finish the year, especially as i have been reading a lot of agatha christie books the past month. once the main plot of the infamous mystery novelist is missing was unfolding, i quickly clocked that it was definitely an homage to agatha christie, in both her work and her mysterious disappearance. i love the nice mix of (misunderstanding) enemies to lovers, but it doesn't overtake the plot too much, and a mystery novel. also the fact that this was marketed as a knives out (which i guess matches with the whole perfect mystery falling into place but that's just common of the genre imo... maybe the entitled relatives of the rich missing author... i guess??) which is one of my favorite movies, though doesn't fully fit as a description, makes me happy 

despite ally carter novels being popular growing up, i don't think i read any? until now and definitely want to look back at the classic ones that i've always heard about but never read. 

maggie was so heartbreaking and endearing to me. yes, i could see that she would seem a little cliche-d with the whole messy back story, but then with our ml of ethan, he also had a less messy but still complicated backstory. they balanced each other out in that way, of both their issues that they needed to work through, and how they viewed the mystery, with ethan assuring and assisting her when maggie struggles to take charge of, frankly her life.

overall i loved the mix of christmassy, agatha christie mystery, and romance genres in this book. ", ,

idk this was a little fun but wish it had a little something more", ,
99,with any luck,ashley poston,3.75,75.00%,43,"2,024",romance,holiday,2024-12-31,2024-12-31,1.0,"this was a cute concept but felt too fast (or maybe i was speed reading to finish this before 2024 ends lolol)
but really if this idea of the love women, focusing on audrey meeting or kissing someone for them to find their soulmate the next time, sounds like a good romcom story and would be so good if it was expanded into a full novel. 

but still fun and cute, with the whole enemies to lovers (except i swear this trope needs a full book for the enemies part to solidify for the reader before it transitions into lovers) of the best woman and man of honor. ", ,
100,royal valentine,sariah wilson,3.50,70.00%,71,"2,024",romance,holiday,2024-12-31,2024-12-31,1.0,"i think conceptually i would've loved it more if those annoying accent word changes weren't in the dialogue bc they really irked me. but otherwise premise was fun and i'm always a sucker for royal romance stories, and the whole switch/roman holiday circumstance is fun. but man it felt rushed and like i didn't get a moment to enjoy and learn more about ilaria and callum, as well as their growing relationship. i dont remember from previous stories other than the one just before this one mentioning ilaria, but i liked how it connected this story to seemingly? the other ones? the nod to callum from the first story was fun as i always enjoy those easter eggs/cameos.", ,
