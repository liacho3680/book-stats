2,if i never met you,mhairi mcfarlane,4.00,80.00%,409,"2,020",romance,adult,April 25,April 29,5.0,"coming off of the highs of watching kdramas with fake dating, I was seeking more fake dating stories to consume. 
SO. although it makes sense, it made me very thirsty? frustrated? mad? that the set up and reasoning for the fake dating took so long to occur in the book. (pssst minor spoiler, <spoiler>the fake dating trope started in roughly second half of the book. <s>don't even get me started on how we don't get to see the couple be in their ~real~ couple moment</s></spoiler>)

BUT i really did enjoy this book. it gave me all the giddy feelings of love and also dealing with the heartbreak of seemingly long-lasting love. and family trauma, spicy topic but enjoyed that element in the story. also i do enjoy a good revenge plot. hehe. 

not to mention the storyline of being a woman in a male-dominated industry, such as working in a law firm spoke to me. not in a relatable woman in the workforce way, but more as treating women right. and also the mental and emotional journey one may go through to see your worth in your life with or without a significant other. 

side note: i love emily. messy, in both the literal and figurative sense, she did really match and balance laurie's more traditional morally set lifestyle. soulmates do not have to be lovers!!! they can be friends or even just people that you meet that change your life!!!", 
3,the dating plan,sara desai,4.00,80.00%,352,"2,021",romance,adult,April 30,May 2,3.0,"going off of my continued hunger for fake dating here we are. 

really enjoyed the child friends reunited into fake dating to fulfill an inheritance stipulation. plus the whole enemies kinda to lovers heh. and a bad boy who turned into a business man?? üò©üí¶üí¶

i also really loved the family elements, both the positive and negative parts about it as well as just having it being contrasted. 

i am not a brown kid so have no clue if there is any accuracy in how a large indian family is portrayed here uhhh yeah. seemed good though? from my limited view of having brown friends? yeah

!!this book does have tw domestic abuse elements mentioned in side characters but not the main part of the story. !! 

overall very solid love story with all the good tropes", 
4,to have and to hoax,martha waters,3.50,70.00%,367,"2,020",romance,historical,May 3,May 10,8.0,"after a recent re-watch of pride and prejudice, i've been wanting more regency romance so here we are..

honestly this was a decent book. the pacing felt slow and like dragging? idk it was hard to get through, even though the relationship dynamics were a strong thing to have me keep reading, specifically within the main 6+ chars

potentially the main reason why it felt slow was the main conflict having a slow burn element. revenge and the long con in this book worked but was mildly painful to go through.

still enjoyed the steamy regency elements in this book and will continue reading this anthology with the main core cast of characters. ", 
5,spyxfamily 2,tatsuya endo,4.00,80.00%,194,"2,019",contemporary,adult,March 21,May 16,57.0,fun stuff. build up with more spy antics., 
6,to love and to loathe,martha waters,4.00,80.00%,384,"2,021",romance,historical,May 11,May 22,12.0,"frenemies to lovers but with friends with benefits? in an gregorian/victorian era (i dont know what exact era)? yeah,,, sign me up

unlike the previous book of this anthology-esque series, this was a good slow burn and build up to the two main leads being utter idiots. there was the bad communication trope but was only in the last quarter of the book so that frustration was short lived. 

definitely a book that i kept wanting to read, though the draggy-ness did leave me distracted to other things lol 

also love to see the series characters come back again with their antics and friendships heh. ngl i‚Äôm not that interested any other relationships in this series after jeremy and diana but will keep reading for those easter eggs. ", 
7,anxious people,fredrik backman,4.50,90.00%,336,"2,019",mystery,fantasy,May 23,May 27,5.0,"i really really loved reading this. the dark comedy elements were perfect, the characterization of the unique cast, how time goes back and forth but made sense, the different perspectives.

somewhat big thinking kinda spicy book but the good thinking kinda spicy book
everytime i read this book, hours flew by (not to mention the chapters are short which helps the reading feeling fast) 

not to spoil any content of the book, but thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns, how backman utilized the changing of perspectives, the breaks in story to add to the suspense. and the conclusion, how everything wraps up and all the strings for the characters are completed and resolved, very full circle feeling.", 
8,the unexpected everything,morgan matson,4.75,95.00%,519,"2,016",romance,teen/ya,August 10,August 13,4.0,"after starting and not finishing so many books for a few months, reading a good 'ole reliable morgan matson summer ya contemporary felt like coming home. all the good feelings.

first off i loved the little cameos from other books (a common morgan matson thing heh)

the plot was not overly complicated but not too simple either. it really felt like the embodiment of spending a summer with friends. and the complicated family things that andie had to heal from and the growth of andie fighting her weaknesses and vices was encouraging. i know how it feels when there's an expectation of people and things in your life, and when it suddenly changes feels like the whole world sucked you up in a black hole. 

(i feel like this makes no cohesive sense oops)

overall, a very good summer read with a little conflict thrown in to make it spicy.]", 
9,vampire academy,richelle mead,3.75,75.00%,332,"2,007",paranormal,teen/ya,October 14,October 15,2.0,"i recently thought about this series and wanted to re-read it again since it's been about 8 years... fast forward to me being bored in lecture and pulling up the ebook on my phone and blew through the re-read. 

exciting to be in this world of moroi and dhampirs. some elements are a bit cringe, reading it again as i'm older but overall good memories of the book and strong female-hero fighting evil vampires.
", 
10,frostbite,richelle mead,4.00,80.00%,327,"2,008",paranormal,teen/ya,October 15,October 16,2.0,"re-reading this book was good. although the review/reaction of this book below does make me cringe, younger me was right. the characterization, how much rose changed from book 1 to book 2 was a noticeable change. yes she is still reckless and rule-breaking but at least she has some sense now to not make big mistakes or at least have the ability and instincts to try and make up from those mistakes and faults. (and yes i love the main character and her love interest together, even though thinking more about them as a couple makes me cringe with the whole ""forbidden romance"" trope. but that could just be older me looking at this sus romance vs younger me liking the love story. ugh.)", 
11,shadow kiss,richelle mead,4.25,85.00%,443,"2,008",paranormal,teen/ya,October 17,October 17,1.0,"this is both a terrible idea and a not bad idea...as i'm basically binge re-reading this series the weekend/few days before my final of my first graduate college class lol. aha. (hey i was either reading this book or studying so,,, shrug)

but i'm depressed, that ending man. i kinda knew it was coming from what i vaguely remember but it still hurts. (and yes their weird age-gap underage romance makes me feel queasy thinking about it in detail but uhhhh it's ""fine"" not really, but sure)

would not say this book had a big progression of rose as a character from the previous book, but she definitely got more interesting and nuanced, i guess. though was mildly frustrated that rose bottled up those dark feelings/trauma and ghosty sightings to herself instead of talking about it, to LITERALLY anyone. and only in the last third did she tackle it with therapy and opening up to her close ones, smh my head.

but safe to say this book was a whirlwind, as i binged it in such a short period of time (12-13 hours? over that period of time). the pacing was good and the intrigue with the strigoi attacks and rose thinking she is going crazy (or maybe not. or maybe she is?) ", 
12,blood promise,richelle mead,4.50,90.00%,503,"2,009",paranormal,teen/ya,October 17,October 19,3.0,"i would consider this book the ‚Äúdark‚Äù plotline in this whole series. very twisty turny, intense but in the long thriller drawn out way and not the intense on my toes like the last book was. not depressing grief like book 2, but more anger/revenger grief (lol is each book a stage of grief ?) 

i do appreciate how rose had more character growth, in her own way lol. by the end of the whole fiasco that was chasing down her killer vampire boyfriend, she did learn the error and mistakes of doing things ‚Äúher own way‚Äù and amended them, or at least a promise to amend those issues with lissa and her mom. ", 
13,spirit bound,richelle mead,3.75,75.00%,489,"2,010",paranormal,teen/ya,October 19,October 23,5.0,"after finishing this book, i have a lot of mixed emotions. felt like the book ended or could have wrapped up or cut off sooner, so a bit dragging. rose was a bit annoying, yes she had her beliefs and was always strong to say what she felt, but her lack of empathy or even just pausing to consider the context of the scenario she was in before she would ""go off"". sigh. this feeling comes up more in the last third to half of the book after the prison break, as politics and being at the royal court has issues more up front now. 

curious and invested in their story, but overall, this book was not as appealing in content even if the pacing of high stakes like the other books were. ", 
14,last sacrifice,richelle mead,4.25,85.00%,594,"2,010",paranormal,teen/ya,October 24,October 26,3.0,"while a little hasty with things to wrap up the plot and reach the ending, overall last sacrifice was a solid finish to an enjoyable series. enjoyed this spur of the moment reread of this series (will probably re-read bloodlines series too bc I don't remember the details of it heh)

not crazy about the,,, morals between rose and dimitri while she was still with adrian (nor had the book have the two of them talk about rose's complicated love life in person at all :////) outside of that whole issue, did like the whole on the run, dimitri and sydney following rose's crazy plot to save lissa again, storyline. ", 
15,people we meet on vacation,emily henry,4.25,85.00%,364,"2,021",romance,adult,May 28,November 10,167.0,"a slow start for me getting into this book, but after getting used to the whole time-jumping between chapters, it enjoyed it. 

it was a slow build up/slow burn into the two finally connecting all the dots. (and yay brief mention of therapy to work through all those emotions and stress) 

a solid read. (also did like the reference of BAR)", 
16,carrie soto is back,taylor jenkins reid,4.50,90.00%,384,"2,022",contemporary,sports,November 11,November 13,3.0,"reading the last quarter of the book on the subway, I had to will myself not to cry in public aha

maybe because I was in the mood for something different than the current mood of reading rom-com-esque books, this was a fresh of breath air and I got hooked immediately. 

it was so much fun to read about soto, with all that drive, all that passion, such great wanting for achievement, and then the journey with how to cope with loss in both not having a mother at a young age and not winning every game. the last part had tears in my eyes, I nearly yelped but again was in the subway and withheld it. strong start, strong conclusion.", 
17,malibu rising,taylor jenkins reid,3.75,75.00%,369,"2,021",contemporary,fame/celebrity,November 13,November 15,3.0,"minor to slightly significant spoilers

----

mick riva is a pos, and it didn't help that I pictured him as aaron echolls' dad from veronica mars lmao (iykyk)
the joy i had when he was confronted by the kids towards the end, satisfaction. 

I do see the criticism of how the second half added much more side characters of their pov of the party and got more and more chaotic and maybe hard to read. I kept up for the most part, and I can see that those short chapters were there to provide context to the lead up of the house being trashed. 

overall it was a thrill of a ride, much anger towards shitty dads, and enjoyed the drama escalation aha. a good read but maybe not the most amazing read. (also coming directly off of reading 'carrie soto is back' it was interesting to see carrie in this context)", 
18,daisy jones & the six,taylor jenkins reid,3.25,65.00%,368,"2,019",contemporary,fame/celebrity,November 15,November 19,5.0,"many mixed feelings about this book, but overall enjoyed it. 
maybe it was the format, because of that a big part of it was hard to get into and stay into it. (but it was interesting reading the book in this transcript/interview style)

I also do like (akin to other authors having a cinematic universe of cameo characters from other books) that we saw a glimpses of characters from ""future"" books. like mick (pukes a little)

I did enjoy the character arcs and how these deeply flawed characters grew whether for better or for worse. twas a good book but maybe not an outright amazing book imo.", 
19,the seven husbands of evelyn hugo,taylor jenkins reid,4.50,90.00%,389,"2,017",romance,fame/celebrity,November 19,November 22,4.0,"i very much enjoyed reading this book, the complexities of a character, but also the genuine drive and motivation that evelyn had is very admirable. 

reading this book gave me all the emotions, anger, sadness, happiness; i rooted for evelyn but also watched as the thing that made her great was also her biggest downfall. and the slow connection between evelyn as she is speaking with monique about her life story, and monique's own story weaved throughout unfolded so well. ", 
20,one true loves,taylor jenkins reid,3.50,70.00%,352,"2,016",romance,contemporary,November 22,November 23,2.0,"i think i feel satisfied after reading this book. mild frustration of the main character emma to decide on which love interest but i understand why she was so hesitant stagnant indecisive. 

i do like the main point that jenkins makes in the book about true love, and even just looking back at relationships whether it be romantic platonic or familial, acknowledging the good and the bad, how much those relationships, those experiences shape you from who you were to who you are now. ", 
21,maybe in another life,taylor jenkins reid,4.00,80.00%,342,"2,015",romance,contemporary,November 25,November 28,4.0,"for a person that likes entertaining the parallel universe theory, I did very much enjoy reading this book

I liked how we split off in story alternating in how hannah's life goes in two different directions, how those two paths would diverge so far apart, sometimes overlap, or even just barely graze each other to acknowledge what could have been

a solid read with satisfying hints about each other's parallel life directions", 
22,after i do,taylor jenkins reid,3.25,65.00%,334,"2,014",contemporary,romance,November 29,December 2,4.0,"man I really did not like ryan.

like I understand that the whole premise of the first part of the book was to show how lauren and ryan met, fell in love, got married, and how their marriage started to fall apart. BUT. he just felt like he had a few red flags while they were dating in college, and I kept thinking that this is a guy you date in college and only in college and learn from it for future relationships. this is not a dude you marry. but yet, here we are. 

other than that, I did like that after lauren moved on from the pain of their falling apart marriage, she started to open up to others, to develop those relationships more. I also liked how the story wrapped (yeah despite annoying ryan lol) and the overall message of life, (i'm a sucker for those carpe diem-esque life messages) how the people we have in our lives, and they are a part of our lives. we chose them and continue to chose them to have in our lives. how these relationships are not relationships that ""complete"" us or ""fill the empty hole"" in us, but simply enhance our state of living. and I like that about it.", 
23,where the crawdads sing,delia owens,4.00,80.00%,384,"2,018",historical,mystery,December 3,December 6,4.0,"weirdly I understand the comments of both positive and negative reviews of this book

positives: very poetic, almost whimsical diction? intense compelling story, especially with the murder trial, this is a mystery novel after all (or at least lightly classes as such).  
as a person that grew up not enjoying large groups of people, a part of me resonated with kya, how she preferred her own solace in the marshes with her thoughts and the birds over people.

negatives: maybe in hand with the whimsical, poetic diction, certain aspects of the book, topics felt like an oversimplification. maybe because it's under the guise of the story taking place in the late 60's, court proceedings felt like it was carried out in a fictional universe, akin to watching law & order or reading to kill a mockingbird (not that i would be a judge to know how accurate it was, but it definitely felt simplified in how the whole process went)
other than mentions of certain species of flora and fauna along with kya's anecdotes about them, I was a little sad that I didn't get to read more about her ""naturalist"" side. descriptions felt more metaphorical, as she looked at slides, looking through biology textbooks. small tidbits. I wanted more details like The Martian, c'mon man, overload me with those details.

overall a decent book, good fun read, but nothing serious. and mostly light mentions about serious topics (race, prejudice, sexual assault, etc.), never delving deep into it", 
24,clockwork angel,cassandra clare,4.25,85.00%,479,"2,010",paranormal,teen/ya,December 7,December 9,3.0,"although not marked on goodreads, i think this is the third time? definitely at least second time reading this book. i had been wanting to re-read this series and catch up with the spin-offs after tmi and tid, but never got to it until now

despite knowing or at least vaguely remembering what occurs in this book, the twist still caught me, the little fools (including me lol) that got tricked in the web of lies. 

but twas a happy time reuniting after many many years with this group of complicatedly broken and traumatized peoples :D i also cherished jem more this time around, whereas before he was just another love interest that i didn't want tessa to be with, aha. 

nostalgic yet fantasical read", 
25,clockwork prince,cassandra clare,4.00,80.00%,498,"2,011",paranormal,teen/ya,December 9,December 12,4.0,"(sidenote: as mentioned in clockwork angel review this is my second? third? time reading this trilogy and  i do recall the main points of the books thus more introspective and this would be a review in context with the other two books)

perhaps because this is the second book in the trilogy, the start was intense as it picks off from the end of clockwork angel, but yet there was no ‚Äúmajor‚Äù thing occurring in comparison to clockwork angel and soon to be clockwork princess 

nonetheless there were some very intense and good things that occurred that i did enjoy:

more jem appreciation! (no spoilers but the circumstances are a bit grim and heartbreaking to say the least)

character growth! mainly from the core three, tessa will and jem but also the not main characters but also not entirely side characters (charlotte, henry, jessamine, sophie etc)

despite more exposition and setting up for the finale that will be clockwork princess, this book did have good set up of plots that only exist in this book and a big fight towards the end! chaos and death and misery, yet success and a vague conclusion hmge
", 
26,clockwork princess,cassandra clare,4.50,90.00%,567,"2,013",paranormal,teen/ya,December 12,December 14,3.0,"second or third read(?):
commonly as with many trilogies, i tend to like the third and last book much more than the others, maybe due to the culminating ~final battle~ or how the author wraps up the characters stories with a satisfactory, hopeful ending. this book applies to all those traits

though looking back, it may not be as intense, as the characters await to face mortmain in the final faceoff, and until that happened small incidents occurred, to build up the climax

despite it all, i still enjoy this book very much. (and i did cry happy & sad tears at the last chapter)
", 
27,city of bones,cassandra clare,3.75,75.00%,485,"2,007",paranormal,teen/ya,December 15,December 29,15.0,"i have read this book/series a many times (though funnily enough the last book in this series only once)

it was... interesting reading it again. i would say equal parts cringe and nostalgic while reading it. tbh the whole storyline, no spoilers, but the jace/clary relationship, ugh not my favorite through this series. but the birthday in the greenhouse is a top favorite scene. 

looking back at this book in the context of what occurs in this series, it's not a bad first book set up to the events that will happen, but it's not great. the disappearance of clary's mom does not feel like a significant and tense event that will set things in motion despite how it technically is (unlike how the story unfolds with the infernal devices). 

idk man, it's okay. 

other other sidenote: it was fun reading this book as i am now familiar with the new york locations lol", 
28,relish,lucy knisley,4.50,90.00%,173,"2,013",memoir,contemporary,December 20,December 21,2.0,"i had this book on my never ending tbr list for a while, but only finally purchased and read this due to a popsugar year challenge lol

nonetheless, i very much loved it. sped read it on the plane. despite not sharing similar childhood, i really resonated with the story. having parents that also love food and exploring different cuisines outside my native ones, really shaped me and my palette like lucy. the art and coloring was so fun and comforting feeling(?) reading this book was like looking back at all my own food memories and experiences growing up. 

will definitely have to try the recipes in the book.

29,city of ashes,cassandra clare,3.25,65.00%,453,"2,008",paranormal,teen/ya,December 20,December 24,5.0,"rereading this again for the third? fourth? time. yeah, definitely a book that i only kept reading because to reread this series lol

maybe because i know certain details (not only from this book but the series in whole) in hindsight but man, the miscommunication is very frustrating. not only the lies that valentine speaks but also people not talking to each other until it's basically too late to go back and resolve things. ughajsflndslkfw

one of my least favorite books in the series, maybe slightly better than city of fallen angels. 

but to speak about only this book aha, it essentially picked up from where we left off in city of bones. simon is acting strange. jace is acting strange. alec is acting strange. honestly everyone is acting strange and not speaking about what they're thinking, the knowledge of things that they have because... pride? fear? 

the high point of this book was the fight on the boat at the end, imo.", 
30,city of glass,cassandra clare,4.75,95.00%,541,"2,009",paranormal,teen/ya,December 25,December 29,5.0,"rereading this book had many conflicting emotions, but still to the test of time and on the third or fourth reread, this is my favorite book in the whole series of the mortal instruments. 

i think what always stood out to me was how the plot moved through this book, that it didn't culminate to a big fight or conflict at the end and have a resolution with some cliffhanger to continue you into the next book. it feels like an end of a trilogy for the first of these three books. more than one huge fight that is plot significant, along with my favorite elements of any story, when the main characters or significant characters of a story all meet and take upon a huge task. 

other than this book being much longer than the previous two, i think i reluctantly wanted to finish this book due to not wanting to read my least favorite book in the series? (idk it may be close with city of ashes), city of fallen angels, which is the next book.", 
31,how to fake it in hollywood,ava wilder,4.50,90.00%,368,"2,022",romance,fame/celebrity,December 29,December 30,2.0,"the whole premise of this book drew me in immediately, hollywood fake dating? my one of my favorite tropes.

the first half? of the book had me addicted and stayed up late reading 75% of the book until 5 am o-o (i started this book a little after midnight). 
but there were aspects of the book i did not realize until they hit, how ethan is grieving the death of his best friend and dealing with a messy divorce and co-parenting all under the umbrella that is being an ""a-list"" celebrity in hollywood. on top of him dealing with abuse and trauma from both the present and past, AND grey also having trauma and just her own vices that she needs to tackle, which made for a whiplashing last third of the book. 

despite this book being short, it felt densely packed in story (but in a good way). i was concerned how the book was going to wrap up when more conflicts arose as we were nearing the last 15-20% of the book, but was pleasantly surprised. i think it wrapped it up well. 

overall a pleasant surprise of a book, and not necessarily the light and fun read that i was expecting in a book when i first picked it up.
